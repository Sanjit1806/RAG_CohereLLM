THE SOUNDING OF THE CALL \\n 5  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nI \\n \\nINTO THE PRIMITIVE \\n \\n \\n \\n“Old longings nomadic leap, \\n        Chafing at custom’s chain, \\n  Again from its brumal sleep \\n        Wakens the ferine strain.” \\n \\n \\n  \\nUCK did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that \\n   trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-\\n   water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from \\nPuget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, \\nhad found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation \\ncompanies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into \\nthe Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were \\nheavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to \\nprotect them from the frost.  \\nBuck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge \\nMiller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden \\namong the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide \\ncool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached \\nby gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading \\nlawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things \\nwere on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great \\nstables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad \\nservants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape B THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 6 \\narbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the \\npumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where \\nJudge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot \\nafternoon.  \\nAnd over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here \\nhe had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs. \\nThere could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not \\ncount. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived \\nobscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the \\nJapanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange creatures that \\nrarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, \\nthere were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful \\npromises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and \\nprotected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.  \\nBut Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm \\nwas his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the \\nJudge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on \\nlong twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the \\nJudge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s \\ngrandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their \\nfootsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable \\nyard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. \\nAmong the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he \\nutterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling, \\nflying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.  \\nHis father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s \\ninseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his \\nfather. He was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty \\npounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. \\nNevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the \\ndignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to \\ncarry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his \\npuppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride \\nin himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes \\nbecome because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by INTO  THE  PRIMITIVE 7 \\nnot becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor \\ndelights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as \\nto the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health \\npreserver.  \\nAnd this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when \\nthe Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen \\nNorth. But Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that \\nManuel, one of the gardener’s helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. \\nManuel had one besetting sin. He loved to play Chinese lottery. Also, in \\nhis gambling, he had one besetting weakness—faith in a system; and this \\nmade his damnation certain. For to play a system requires money, while \\nthe wages of a gardener’s helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and \\nnumerous progeny.  \\nThe Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers’ Association, and \\nthe boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night \\nof Manuel’s treachery. No one saw him and Buck go off through the \\norchard on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll. And with the \\nexception of a solitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag \\nstation known as College Park. This man talked with Manuel, and \\nmoney chinked between them.  \\n“You might wrap up the goods before you deliver ’m,” the stranger \\nsaid gruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck’s \\nneck under the collar.  \\n“Twist it, an’ you’ll choke ’m plentee,” said Manuel, and the \\nstranger grunted a ready affirmative.  \\nBuck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an \\nunwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and \\nto give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the \\nends of the rope were placed in the stranger’s hands, he growled \\nmenacingly. He had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride \\nbelieving that to intimate was to command. But to his surprise the rope \\ntightened around his neck, shutting off his breath. In quick rage he \\nsprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled him close by the \\nthroat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his back. Then the rope \\ntightened mercilessly, while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 8 \\nout of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely. Never in all his life \\nhad he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so \\nangry. But his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing \\nwhen the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage \\ncar.  \\nThe next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting \\nand that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The \\nhoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he \\nwas. He had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation \\nof riding in a baggage car. He opened his eyes, and into them came the \\nunbridled anger of a kidnapped king. The man sprang for his throat, but \\nBuck was too quick for him. His jaws closed on the hand, nor did they \\nrelax till his senses were choked out of him once more.  \\n“Yep, has fits,” the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the \\nbaggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. “I’m \\ntakin’ ’m up for the boss to ’Frisco. A crack dog-doctor there thinks that \\nhe can cure ’m.”  \\nConcerning that night’s ride, the man spoke most eloquently for \\nhimself, in a little shed, back of a saloon on the San Francisco water \\nfront.  \\n“All I get is fifty for it,” he grumbled; “an’ I wouldn’t do it over for a \\nthousand, cold cash.”  \\nHis hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right \\ntrouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle.  \\n“How much did the other mug get?” the saloon-keeper demanded.  \\n“A hundred,” was the reply. “Wouldn’t take a sou less, so help me.”  \\n“That makes a hundred and fifty,” the saloon-keeper calculated; “and \\nhe’s worth it, or I’m a squarehead.”  \\nThe kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his \\nlacerated hand. “If I don’t get the hydrophoby—”  \\n“It’ll be because you was born to hang,” laughed the saloon-keeper. \\n“Here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,” he added.  \\nDazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the \\nlife half throttled out of him, Buck attempted to face his tormentors. But \\nhe was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing INTO  THE  PRIMITIVE 9 \\nthe heavy brass collar from off his neck. Then the rope was removed, \\nand he was flung into a cagelike crate.  \\nThere he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath \\nand wounded pride. He could not understand what it all meant. What did \\nthey want with him, these strange men? Why were they keeping him \\npent up in this narrow crate? He did not know why, but he felt oppressed \\nby the vague sense of impending calamity. Several times during the \\nnight he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to \\nsee the Judge, or the boys at least. But each time it was the bulging face \\nof the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow \\ncandle. And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck’s throat was \\ntwisted into a savage growl.  \\nBut the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men \\nentered and picked up the crate. More tormentors, Buck decided, for \\nthey were evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed \\nand raged at them through the bars. They only laughed and poked sticks \\nat him, which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that \\nwas what they wanted. Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the \\ncrate to be lifted into a wagon. Then he, and the crate in which he was \\nimprisoned, began a passage through many hands. Clerks in the express \\noffice took charge of him; he was carted about in another wagon; a truck \\ncarried him, with an assortment of boxes and parcels, upon a ferry \\nsteamer; he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot, and \\nfinally he was deposited in an express car.  \\nFor two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail \\nof shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate \\nnor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express \\nmessengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When \\nhe flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at \\nhim and taunted him. They growled and barked like detestable dogs, \\nmewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he \\nknew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger waxed \\nand waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of water \\ncaused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever pitch. For that \\nmatter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment had flung him THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 10 \\ninto a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and \\nswollen throat and tongue.  \\nHe was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given \\nthem an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them. \\nThey would never get another rope around his neck. Upon that he was \\nresolved. For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during \\nthose two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath \\nthat boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him. His eyes turned \\nbloodshot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed \\nwas he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him; and the \\nexpress messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the \\ntrain at Seattle.  \\nFour men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small, \\nhigh-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged \\ngenerously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver. That \\nwas the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled himself \\nsavagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet \\nand a club.  \\n“You ain’t going to take him out now?” the driver asked.  \\n“Sure,” the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.  \\nThere was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had \\ncarried it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to \\nwatch the performance.  \\nBuck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging \\nand wrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was \\nthere on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get out \\nas the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.  \\n“Now, you red-eyed devil,” he said, when he had made an opening \\nsufficient for the passage of Buck’s body. At the same time he dropped \\nthe hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.  \\nAnd Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for \\nthe spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his bloodshot \\neyes. Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds \\nof fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights. In mid \\nair, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he received a shock INTO  THE  PRIMITIVE 11 \\nthat checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing \\nclip. He whirled over, fetching the ground on h is back and side. He had \\nnever been struck by a club in his life, and did not understand. With a \\nsnarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and \\nlaunched into the air. And again the shock came and he was brought \\ncrushingly to the ground. This time he was aware that it was the club, \\nbut his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he charged, and as \\noften the club broke the charge and smashed him down.  \\nAfter a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to \\nrush. He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth \\nand ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver. Then \\nthe man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the \\nnose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the \\nexquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its \\nferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the \\nclub from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same \\ntime wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete \\ncircle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on h is \\nhead and chest.  \\nFor the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had \\npurposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down, \\nknocked utterly senseless.  \\n“He’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot I say,” one of the men on \\nthe wall cried enthusiastically.  \\n“Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,” was the \\nreply of the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.  \\nBuck’s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where \\nhe had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.  \\n“ ‘Answers to the name of Buck,’ ” the man soliloquized, quoting \\nfrom the saloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the consignment of \\nthe crate and contents. “Well, Buck, my boy,” he went on in a genial \\nvoice, “we’ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let \\nit go at that. You’ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog \\nand all’ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I’ll whale \\nthe stuffin’ outa you. Understand?”  THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 12 \\nAs he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly \\npounded, and though Buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the \\nhand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he \\ndrank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by \\nchunk, from the man’s hand.  \\nHe was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once \\nfor all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had \\nlearned the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club \\nwas a revelation. It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law, \\nand he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer \\naspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the \\nlatent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs \\ncame, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging \\nand roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass \\nunder the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as \\nhe looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to \\nBuck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though \\nnot necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he \\ndid see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails, \\nand licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate \\nnor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.  \\nNow and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, \\nwheedlingly, and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. \\nAnd at such times that money passed between them the strangers took \\none or more of the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they \\nwent, for they never came back; but the fear of the future was strong \\nupon him, and he was glad each time when he was not selected.  \\nYet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man \\nwho spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations \\nwhich Buck could not understand.  \\n“Sacredam!” he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck. “Dat one dam \\nbully dog! Eh? How moch?”  \\n“Three hundred, and a present at that,” was the prompt reply of the \\nman in the red sweater. “And seein’ it’s government money, you ain’t \\ngot no kick coming, eh, Perrault?”  INTO  THE  PRIMITIVE 13 \\nPerrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been \\nboomed skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for \\nso fine an animal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor \\nwould its despatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he \\nlooked at Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand—“One in ten \\nt’ousand,” he commented mentally.  \\nBuck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when \\nCurly, a good-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little \\nweazened man. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, \\nand as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the \\nNarwhal, it was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he \\nwere taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant \\ncalled François. Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but \\nFrançois was a French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They \\nwere a new kind of men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many \\nmore), and while he developed no affection for them, he none the less \\ngrew honestly to respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and \\nFrançois were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and \\ntoo wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.  \\nIn the ’tween-decks of the Narwhal, Buck and Curly joined two \\nother dogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen \\nwho had been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later \\naccompanied a Geological Survey into the Barrens.  \\nHe was friendly, in a treacherous sort of way, smiling into one’s face \\nthe while he meditated some underhand trick, as, for instance, when he \\nstole from Buck’s food at the first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, \\nthe lash of François’s whip sang through the air, reaching the culprit \\nfirst; and nothing remained to Buck but to recover the bone. That was \\nfair of François, he decided, and the half-breed began his rise in Buck’s \\nestimation.  \\nThe other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not \\nattempt to steal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow, \\nand he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and \\nfurther, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. “Dave” he \\nwas called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 14 \\ninterest in nothing, not even when the Narwhal crossed Queen Charlotte \\nSound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed. When \\nBuck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he raised his head as \\nthough annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and \\nwent to sleep again.  \\nDay and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller, \\nand though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that \\nthe weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the \\npropeller was quiet, and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere \\nof excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change \\nwas at hand. François leashed them and brought them on deck. At the \\nfirst step upon the cold surface, Buck’s feet sank into a white mushy \\nsomething very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of this \\nwhite stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but more of it \\nfell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his \\ntongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This puzzled him. \\nHe tried it again, with the same result. The onlookers laughed \\nuproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was his first \\nsnow.  \\n 15  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nII \\n \\nTHE LAW OF CLUB AND FANG \\n \\n \\n  \\nUCK’S first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every \\n   hour was filled with shock and surprise. He had been suddenly \\n   jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of \\nthings primordial. No lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do \\nbut loaf and be bored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment’s \\nsafety. All was confusion and action, and every moment life and limb \\nwere in peril. There was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these \\ndogs and men were not town dogs and men. They were savages, all of \\nthem, who knew no law but the law of club and fang.  \\nHe had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and \\nhis first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. It is true, it was a \\nvicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it. Curly \\nwas the victim. They were camped near the log store, where she, in her \\nfriendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown \\nwolf, though not half so large as she. There was no warning, only a leap \\nin like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out equally swift, and \\nCurly’s face was ripped open from eye to jaw.  \\nIt was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there \\nwas more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and \\nsurrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. Buck did not \\ncomprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they \\nwere licking their chops. Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again \\nand leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar \\nfashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them. This was B THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 16 \\nwhat the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her, \\nsnarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath \\nthe bristling mass of bodies.  \\nSo sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He \\nsaw Spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he \\nsaw François, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men \\nwith clubs were helping him to scatter them. It did not take long. Two \\nminutes from the time Curly went down, the last of her assailants were \\nclubbed off. But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled \\nsnow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing over \\nher and cursing horribly. The scene often came back to Buck to trouble \\nhim in his sleep. So that was the way. No fairplay. Once down, that was \\nthe end of you. Well, he would see to it that he never went down. Spitz \\nran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that moment Buck hated \\nhim with a bitter and deathless hatred.  \\nBefore he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing \\nof Curly, he received another shock. François fastened upon him an \\narrangement of straps and buckles. It was a harness, such as he had seen \\nthe grooms put on the horses at home. And as he had seen horses work, \\nso he was set to work, hauling François on a sled to the forest that \\nfringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. Though his \\ndignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was too \\nwise to rebel. He buckled down with a will and did his best, though it \\nwas all new and strange. François was stern, demanding instant \\nobedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience; while \\nDave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped Buck’s hind quarters \\nwhenever he was in error. Spitz was the leader, likewise experienced, \\nand while he could not always get at Buck, he growled sharp reproof \\nnow and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck \\ninto the way he should go. Buck learned easily, and under the combined \\ntuition of his two mates and François made remarkable progress. Ere \\nthey returned to camp he knew enough to stop at “ho,” to go ahead at \\n“mush,” to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler \\nwhen the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.  THE  LAW  OF  CLUB  AND  FANG 17 \\n“T’ree vair’ good dog s,” François told Perrault. “Dat Buck, heem \\npool lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt’ing.”  \\nBy afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his \\ndespatches, returned with two more dogs. “Billee” and “Joe” he called \\nthem, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of the one mother \\nthough they were, they were as different as day and night. Billee’s one \\nfault was his excessive good nature, while Joe was the very opposite, \\nsour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye. Buck \\nreceived them in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz \\nproceeded to thrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his tail \\nappeasingly, turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no \\navail, and cried (still appeasingly) when Spitz’s sharp teeth scored his \\nflank. But no matter how Spitz circled, Joe whirled around on his heels \\nto face him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and snarling, \\njaws clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes diabolically \\ngleaming—the incarnation of belligerent fear. So terrible was his \\nappearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him; but to cover \\nhis own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing Billee \\nand drove him to the confines of the camp.  \\nBy evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and \\nlean and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed \\na warning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks, \\nwhich means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave \\nnothing, expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and \\ndeliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one \\npeculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like \\nto be approached on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly \\nguilty, and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-\\nleks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three \\ninches up and down. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to \\nthe last of their comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent \\nambition, like Dave’s, was to be left alone; though, as Buck was \\nafterward to learn, each of them possessed one other and even more vital \\nambition.  THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 18 \\nThat night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent, \\nillumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; \\nand when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and François \\nbombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from \\nhis consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. A chill \\nwind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom \\ninto his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and attempted to \\nsleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. Miserable and \\ndisconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that \\none place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs rushed \\nupon him, but he bristled his neck hair and snarled (for he was learning \\nfast), and they let him go his way unmolested.  \\nFinally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own \\nteam-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had \\ndisappeared. Again he wandered about through the great camp, looking \\nfor them, and again he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could \\nnot be, else he would not have been driven out. Then where could they \\npossibly be? With drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, \\nhe aimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his \\nfore legs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He \\nsprang back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. \\nBut a friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. \\nA whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under \\nthe snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed and \\nwriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a \\nbribe for peace, to lick Buck’s face with his warm wet tongue.  \\nAnother lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck \\nconfidently selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort \\nproceeded to dig a hole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body \\nfilled the confined space and he was asleep. The day had been long and \\narduous, and he slept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and \\nbarked and wrestled with bad dreams.  \\nNor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking \\ncamp. At first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the \\nnight and he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on THE  LAW  OF  CLUB  AND  FANG 19 \\nevery side, and a great surge of fear swept through him—the fear of the \\nwild thing for the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through \\nhis own life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an \\nunduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so \\ncould not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted \\nspasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders stood \\non end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the \\nblinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he \\nlanded on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and \\nknew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time \\nhe went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the \\nnight before.  \\nA shout from François hailed his appearance. “Wot I say?” the dog-\\ndriver cried to Perrault. “Dat Buck for sure learn queek as anyt’ing.”  \\nPerrault nodded gravely. As courier for the Canadian Government, \\nbearing important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs, \\nand he was particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck.  \\nThree more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a \\ntotal of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were \\nin harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Cañon. Buck was \\nglad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not \\nparticularly despise it. He was surprised at the eagerness which animated \\nthe whole team, and which was communicated to him; but still more \\nsurprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. They were new \\ndogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All passiveness and unconcern \\nhad dropped from them. They were alert and active, anxious that the \\nwork should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by delay or \\nconfusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed the supreme \\nexpression of their being, and all that they lived for and the only thing in \\nwhich they took delight.  \\nDave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was Buck, \\nthen came Sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file, \\nto the leader, which position was filled by Spitz.  \\nBuck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that \\nhe might receive instruction. Apt scholar that he was, they were equally THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 20 \\napt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing \\ntheir teaching with their sharp teeth. Dave was fair and very wise. He \\nnever nipped Buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when \\nhe stood in need of it. As François’s whip backed him up, Buck found it \\nto be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. Once, during a brief \\nhalt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both Dave \\nand Sol-leks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. The \\nresulting tangle was even worse, but Buck took good care to keep the \\ntraces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he \\nmastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. François’s whip \\nsnapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up \\nhis feet and carefully examining them.  \\nIt was a hard day’s run, up the Cañon, through Sheep Camp, past the \\nScales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of \\nfeet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between the \\nsalt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely \\nNorth. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the \\ncraters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge \\ncamp at the head of Lake Bennett, where thousands of gold-seekers were \\nbuilding boats against the breakup of the ice in the spring. Buck made \\nhis hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all too \\nearly was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates \\nto the sled.  \\nThat day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next \\nday, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked \\nharder, and made poorer time. As a rule, Perrault travelled ahead of the \\nteam, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them. \\nFrançois, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged places \\nwith him, but not often. Perrault was in a hurry, and he prided himself on \\nhis knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for the fall \\nice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was no ice at \\nall.  \\nDay after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces. Always, \\nthey broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them \\nhitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. And always they THE  LAW  OF  CLUB  AND  FANG 21 \\npitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling to sleep \\ninto the snow. Buck was ravenous. The pound and a half of sun-dried \\nsalmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go nowhere. He \\nnever had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs. Yet the \\nother dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the life, received \\na pound on ly of the fish and managed to keep in good condition.  \\nHe swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old \\nlife. A dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed him \\nof his unfinished ration. There was no defending it. While he was \\nfighting off two or three, it was disappearing down the throats of the \\nothers. To remedy this, he ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did hunger \\ncompel him, he was not above taking what did not belong to him. He \\nwatched and learned. When he saw Pike, one of the new dogs, a clever \\nmalingerer and thief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault’s back \\nwas turned, he duplicated the performance the following day, getting \\naway with the whole chunk. A great uproar was raised, but he was \\nunsuspected; while Dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting \\ncaught, was punished for Buck’s misdeed.  \\nThis first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland \\nenvironment. It marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself to \\nchanging conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and \\nterrible death. It marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his \\nmoral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for \\nexistence. It was all well enough in the Southland, under the law of love \\nand fellowship, to respect private property and personal feelings; but in \\nthe Northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such things \\ninto account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he would fail \\nto prosper.  \\nNot that Buck reasoned it out. He was fit, that was all, and \\nunconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life. All his \\ndays, no matter what the odds, he had never run from a fight. But the \\nclub of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more \\nfundamental and primitive code. Civilized, he could have died for a \\nmoral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller’s riding-whip; but \\nthe completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 22 \\nto flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide. \\nHe did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his stomach. \\nHe did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out of respect \\nfor club and fang. In short, the things he did were done because it was \\neasier to do them than not to do them.  \\nHis development (or retrogression) was rapid. His muscles became \\nhard as iron, and he grew callous to all ordinary pain. He achieved an \\ninternal as well as external economy. He could eat anything, no matter \\nhow loathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his stomach \\nextracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood carried it to \\nthe farthest reaches of his body, building it into the toughest and stoutest \\nof tissues. Sight and scent became remarkably keen, while his hearing \\ndeveloped such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound \\nand knew whether it heralded peace or peril. He learned to bite the ice \\nout with his teeth when it collected between his toes; and when he was \\nthirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole, he would \\nbreak it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs. His most \\nconspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night \\nin advance. No matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by \\ntree or bank, the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward, \\nsheltered and snug.  \\nAnd not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead \\nbecame alive again. The domesticated generations fell from him. In \\nvague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time \\nthe wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed \\ntheir meat as they ran it down. It was no task for him to learn to fight \\nwith cut and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought \\nforgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old \\ntricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his \\ntricks. They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had \\nbeen his always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose \\nat a star and howled long and wolf-like, it was his ancestors, dead and \\ndust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and \\nthrough him. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which THE  LAW  OF  CLUB  AND  FANG 23 \\nvoiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stillness, and \\nthe cold, and dark.  \\nThus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged \\nthrough him and he came into his own again; and he came because men \\nhad found a yellow metal in the North, and because Manuel was a \\ngardener’s helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife \\nand divers small copies of himself.  \\n 24  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIII \\n \\nTHE DOMINANT PRIMORDIAL BEAST \\n \\n \\n  \\nHE dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck, and under the \\n   fierce conditions of trail life it grew and grew. Yet it was a secret \\n   growth. His new-born cunning gave him poise and control. He \\nwas too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not \\nonly did he not pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. A \\ncertain deliberateness characterized his attitude. He was not prone to \\nrashness and precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and \\nSpitz he betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.  \\nOn the other hand, possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous \\nrival, Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. He even went \\nout of his way to bully Buck, striving constantly to start the fight which \\ncould end only in the death of one or the other.  \\nEarly in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an \\nunwonted accident. At the end of this day they made a bleak and \\nmiserable camp on the shore of Lake Le Barge. Driving snow, a wind \\nthat cut like a white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for \\na camping place. They could hardly have fared worse. At their backs \\nrose a perpendicular wall of rock, and Perrault and François were \\ncompelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of \\nthe lake itself. The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel \\nlight. A few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed \\ndown through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.  \\nClose in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and \\nwarm was it, that he was loath to leave it when François distributed the T THE  DOMINANT  PRIMORDIAL  BEAST 25 \\nfish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished his \\nration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl told \\nhim that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided trouble \\nwith his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared. He \\nsprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and Spitz \\nparticularly, for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him \\nthat his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own \\nonly because of his great weight and size.  \\nFrançois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the \\ndisrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. “A-a-ah!” he cried \\nto Buck. “Gif it to heem, by Gar! Gif it to heem, the dirty t’eef!”  \\nSpitz was equally willing. He was crying with sheer rage and \\neagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. Buck \\nwas no less eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and \\nforth for the advantage. But it was then that the unexpected happened, \\nthe thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the \\nfuture, past many a weary mile of trail and toil.  \\nAn oath from Perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony \\nframe, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of \\npandemonium. The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with \\nskulking furry forms—starving huskies, four or five score of them, who \\nhad scented the camp from some Indian village. They had crept in while \\nBuck and Spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among \\nthem with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. They \\nwere crazed by the smell of the food. Perrault found one with head \\nburied in the grub-box. His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and \\nthe grub-box was capsized on the ground. On the instant a score of the \\nfamished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. The clubs fell \\nupon them unheeded. They yelped and howled under the rain of blows, \\nbut struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.  \\nIn the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests \\nonly to be set upon by the fierce invaders. Never had Buck seen such \\ndogs. It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins. \\nThey were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with \\nblazing eyes and slavered fangs. But the hunger-madness made them THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 26 \\nterrifying, irresistible. There was no opposing them. The team-dogs were \\nswept back against the cliff at the first onset. Buck was beset by three \\nhuskies, and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed. \\nThe din was frightful. Billee was crying as usual. Dave and Sol-leks, \\ndripping blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely side by \\nside. Joe was snapping like a demon. Once his teeth closed on the fore \\nleg of a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. Pike, the \\nmalingerer, leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a \\nquick flash of teeth and a jerk, Buck got a frothing adversary by the \\nthroat, and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the \\njugular. The warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater \\nfierceness. He flung himself upon another, and at the same time felt \\nteeth sink into his own throat. It was Spitz, treacherously attacking from \\nthe side.  \\nPerrault and François, having cleaned out their part of the camp, \\nhurried to save their sled-dogs. The wild wave of famished beasts rolled \\nback before them, and Buck shook himself free. But it was only for a \\nmoment. The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub, \\nupon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. Billee, \\nterrified into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away \\nover the ice. Pike and Dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the \\nteam behind. As Buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of \\nthe tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident intention \\nof overthrowing him. Once off his feet and under that mass of huskies, \\nthere was no hope for him. But he braced himself to the shock of Spitz’s \\ncharge, then joined the flight out on the lake.  \\nLater, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the \\nforest. Though un pursued, they were in a sorry plight. There was not one \\nwho was not wounded in four or five places, while some were wounded \\ngrievously. Dub was badly injured in a hind leg; Dolly, the last husky \\nadded to the team at Dyea, had a badly torn throat; Joe had lost an eye; \\nwhile Billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons, \\ncried and whimpered throughout the night. At daybreak they limped \\nwarily back to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad \\ntempers. Fully half their grub supply was gone. The huskies had chewed THE  DOMINANT  PRIMORDIAL  BEAST 27 \\nthrough the sled lashings and canvas coverings. In fact, nothing, no \\nmatter how remotely eatable, had escaped them. They had eaten a pair of \\nPerrault’s moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the leather traces, and \\neven two feet of lash from the end of François’s whip. He broke from a \\nmournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs.  \\n“Ah, my frien’s,” he said softly, “mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose \\nmany bites. Mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! Wot you t’ink, eh, Perrault?”  \\nThe courier shook his head dubiously. With four hundred miles of \\ntrail still between him and Dawson, he could ill afford to have madness \\nbreak out among his dogs. Two hours of cursing and exertion got the \\nharnesses into shape, and the wound-stiffened team was under way, \\nstruggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet \\nencountered, and for that matter, the hardest between them and Dawson.  \\nThe Thirty Mile River was wide open. Its wild water defied the frost, \\nand it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held at \\nall. Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty \\nterrible miles. And terrible they were, for every foot of them was \\naccomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. A dozen times, Perrault, \\nnosing the way, broke through the ice bridges, being saved by the long \\npole he carried, which he so held that it fell each time across the hole \\nmade by his body. But a cold snap was on, the thermometer registering \\nfifty below zero, and each time he broke through he was compelled for \\nvery life to build a fire and dry his garments.  \\nNothing daunted him. It was because nothing daunted him that he \\nhad been chosen for government courier. He took all manner of risks, \\nresolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling \\non from dim dawn to dark. He skirted the frowning shores on rim ice \\nthat bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt. \\nOnce, the sled broke through, with Dave and Buck, and they were half-\\nfrozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. The usual \\nfire was necessary to save them. They were coated solidly with ice, and \\nthe two men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and thawing, \\nso close that they were singed by the flames.  \\nAt another time Spitz went through, dragging the whole team after \\nhim up to Buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 28 \\npaws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. \\nBut behind him was Dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the \\nsled was François, pulling till his tendons cracked.  \\nAgain, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no \\nescape except up the cliff. Perrault scaled it by a miracle, while François \\nprayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled lashing and \\nthe last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs were hoisted, one \\nby one, to the cliff crest. François came up last, after the sled and load. \\nThen came the search for a place to descend, which descent was \\nultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night found them back on the \\nriver with a quarter of a mile to the day’s credit.  \\nBy the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck was \\nplayed out. The rest of the dogs were in like condition; but Perrault, to \\nmake up lost time, pushed them late and early. The first day they \\ncovered thirty-five miles to the Big Salmon; the next day thirty-five \\nmore to the Little Salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them \\nwell up toward the Five Fingers.  \\nBuck’s feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies. \\nHis had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild \\nancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. All day long he \\nlimped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. \\nHungry as he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, \\nwhich François had to bring to him. Also, the dog-driver rubbed Buck’s \\nfeet for half an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of \\nhis own moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck. This was a great \\nrelief, and Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist itself \\ninto a grin one morning, when François forgot the moccasins and Buck \\nlay on his back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and refused \\nto budge without them. Later his feet grew hard to the trail, and the \\nworn-out foot-gear was thrown away.  \\nAt the Pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, Dolly, who \\nhad never been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. She \\nannounced her condition by a long, heart-breaking wolf howl that sent \\nevery dog bristling with fear, then sprang straight for Buck. He had \\nnever seen a dog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; THE  DOMINANT  PRIMORDIAL  BEAST 29 \\nyet he knew that here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. \\nStraight away he raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap \\nbehind; nor could she gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he \\nleave her, so great was her madness. He plunged through the wooded \\nbreast of the island, flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel \\nfilled with rough ice to another island, gained a third island, curved back \\nto the main river, and in desperation started to cross it. And all the time, \\nthough he did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap behind. \\nFrançois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back, \\nstill one leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in \\nthat François would save him. The dog-driver held the axe poised in his \\nhand, and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad \\nDolly’s head.  \\nBuck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath, \\nhelpless. This was Spitz’s opportunity. He sprang upon Buck, and twice \\nhis teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the \\nbone. Then François’s lash descended, and Buck had the satisfaction of \\nwatching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of \\nthe team.  \\n“One devil, dat Spitz,” remarked Perrault. “Some dam day heem keel \\ndat Buck.”  \\n“Dat Buck two devils,” was François’s rejoinder. “All de tam I \\nwatch dat Buck I know for sure. Lissen: some dam fine day heem get \\nmad lak hell an’ den heem chew dat Spitz all up an’ spit heem out on de \\nsnow. Sure. I know.”  \\nFrom then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and \\nacknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this \\nstrange Southland dog. And strange Buck was to him, for of the many \\nSouthland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp \\nand on trail. They were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and \\nstarvation. Buck was the exception. He alone endured and prospered, \\nmatching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. Then he was a \\nmasterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club \\nof the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 30 \\nout of his desire for mastery. He was preëminently cunning, and could \\nbide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.  \\nIt was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. Buck \\nwanted it. He wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been \\ngripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and \\ntrace—that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which \\nlures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts if they \\nare cut out of the harness. This was the pride of Dave as wheel-dog, of \\nSol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride that laid hold of \\nthem at break of camp, transforming them from sour and sullen brutes \\ninto straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride that spurred them on \\nall day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night, letting them fall back \\ninto gloomy unrest and uncontent. This was the pride that bore up Spitz \\nand made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered and shirked in the \\ntraces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning. Likewise it was \\nthis pride that made him fear Buck as a possible lead-dog. And this was \\nBuck’s pride, too.  \\nHe openly threatened the other’s leadership. He came between him \\nand the shirks he should have punished. And he did it deliberately. One \\nnight there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning Pike, the \\nmalingerer, did not appear. He was securely hidden in his nest under a \\nfoot of snow. François called him and sought him in vain. Spitz was wild \\nwith wrath. He raged through the camp, smelling and digging in every \\nlikely place, snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and shivered in his \\nhiding-place.  \\nBut when he was at last unearthed, and Spitz flew at him to punish \\nhim, Buck flew, with equal rage, in between. So unexpected was it, and \\nso shrewdly managed, that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet. \\nPike, who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny, \\nand sprang upon his overthrown leader. Buck, to whom fairplay was a \\nforgotten code, likewise sprang upon Spitz. But François, chuckling at \\nthe incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought \\nhis lash down upon Buck with all his might. This failed to drive Buck \\nfrom his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into play. \\nHalf-stunned by the blow, Buck was knocked backward and the lash laid THE  DOMINANT  PRIMORDIAL  BEAST 31 \\nupon him again and again, while Spitz soundly punished the many times \\noffending Pike.  \\nIn the days that followed, as Dawson grew closer and closer, Buck \\nstill continued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits; but he did it \\ncraftily, when François was not around, With the covert mutiny of Buck, \\na general insubordination sprang up and increased. Dave and Sol-leks \\nwere unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse. Things \\nno longer went right. There was continual bickering and jangling. \\nTrouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was Buck. He kept \\nFrançois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the \\nlife-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place \\nsooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling and \\nstrife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe, fearful \\nthat Buck and Spitz were at it.  \\nBut the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into \\nDawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. Here \\nwere many men, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. It \\nseemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work. All day they \\nswung up and down the main street in long teams, and in the night their \\njingling bells still went by. They hauled cabin logs and firewood, \\nfreighted up to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in \\nthe Santa Clara Valley. Here and there Buck met Southland dogs, but in \\nthe main they were the wild wolf husky breed. Every night, regularly, at \\nnine, at twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie \\nchant, in which it was Buck’s delight to join.  \\nWith the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars \\nleaping in the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of \\nsnow, this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life, only \\nit was pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and half-sobs, and \\nwas more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of existence. It was \\nan old song, old as the breed itself—one of the first songs of the younger \\nworld in a day when songs were sad. It was invested with the woe of \\nunnumbered generations, this plaint by which Buck was so strangely \\nstirred. When he moaned and sobbed, it was with the pain of living that \\nwas of old the pain of his wild fathers, and the fear and mystery of the THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 32 \\ncold and dark that was to them fear and mystery. And that he should be \\nstirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back \\nthrough the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the \\nhowling ages.  \\nSeven days from the time they pulled into Dawson, they dropped \\ndown the steep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail, and pulled for \\nDyea and Salt Water. Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more \\nurgent than those he had brought in; also, the travel pride had gripped \\nhim, and he purposed to make the record trip of the year. Several things \\nfavored him in this. The week’s rest had recuperated the dogs and put \\nthem in thorough trim. The trail they had broken into the country was \\npacked hard by later journeyers. And further, the police had arranged in \\ntwo or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was \\ntravelling light.  \\nThey made Sixty Mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and \\nthe second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to \\nPelly. But such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble \\nand vexation on the part of François. The insidious revolt led by Buck \\nhad destroyed the solidarity of the team. It no longer was as one dog \\nleaping in the traces. The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them \\ninto all kinds of petty misdemeanors. No more was Spitz a leader greatly \\nto be feared. The old awe departed, and they grew equal to challenging \\nhis authority. Pike robbed him of half a fish one night, and gulped it \\ndown under the protection of Buck. Another night Dub and Joe fought \\nSpitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved. And even \\nBillee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not half so \\nplacatingly as in former days. Buck never came near Spitz without \\nsnarling and bristling menacingly. In fact, his conduct approached that \\nof a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before Spitz’s \\nvery nose.  \\nThe breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their \\nrelations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever \\namong themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave \\nand Sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by \\nthe unending squabbling. François swore strange barbarous oaths, and THE  DOMINANT  PRIMORDIAL  BEAST 33 \\nstamped the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. His lash was always \\nsinging among the dogs, but it was of small avail. Directly his back was \\nturned they were at it again. He backed up Spitz with his whip, while \\nBuck backed up the remainder of the team. François knew he was \\nbehind all the trouble, and Buck knew he knew; but Buck was too clever \\never again to be caught red-handed. He worked faithfully in the harness, \\nfor the toil had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater delight slyly \\nto precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces.  \\nAt the mouth of the Tahkeena, one night after supper, Dub turned up \\na snowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. In a second the whole team \\nwas in full cry. A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest \\nPolice, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. The rabbit \\nsped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed of \\nwhich it held steadily. It ran lightly on the surface of the snow, while the \\ndogs ploughed through by main strength. Buck led the pack, sixty \\nstrong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay down low \\nto the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing forward, leap by \\nleap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap, like some pale frost \\nwraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.  \\nAll that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men \\nout from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by \\nchemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to kill—all \\nthis was Buck’s, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was ranging at \\nthe head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the living meat, to \\nkill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood.  \\nThere is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which \\nlife cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes \\nwhen one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that \\none is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist, \\ncaught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the soldier, \\nwar-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it came to Buck, \\nleading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining after the food that \\nwas alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight. He \\nwas sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the parts of his nature that \\nwere deeper than he, going back into the womb of Time. He was THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 34 \\nmastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being, the perfect \\njoy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was everything \\nthat was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing itself in \\nmovement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead \\nmatter that did not move.  \\nBut Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the \\npack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long \\nbend around. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the \\nfrost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and larger \\nfrost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of \\nthe rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the white teeth \\nbroke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may \\nshriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging down from Life’s apex \\nin the grip of Death, the full pack at Buck’s heels raised a hell’s chorus \\nof delight.  \\nBuck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon \\nSpitz, shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They \\nrolled over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost \\nas though he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder \\nand leaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of \\na trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips \\nthat writhed and snarled.  \\nIn a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As \\nthey circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the \\nadvantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He \\nseemed to remember it all,—the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, \\nand the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly \\ncalm. There was not the faintest whisper of air—nothing moved, not a \\nleaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering \\nin the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these \\ndogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an \\nexpectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and \\ntheir breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was nothing new or \\nstrange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had always been, the \\nwonted way of things.  THE  DOMINANT  PRIMORDIAL  BEAST 35 \\nSpitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, \\nand across Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner \\nof dogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but \\nnever blind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his \\nenemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till he \\nwas prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first defended \\nthat attack.  \\nIn vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog. \\nWherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by \\nthe fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding, \\nbut Buck could not penetrate his enemy’s guard. Then he warmed up \\nand enveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he \\ntried for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, \\nand each time and every time Spitz slashed him and got away. Then \\nBuck took to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing \\nback his head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder \\nat the shoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But \\ninstead, Buck’s shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped \\nlightly away.  \\nSpitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and \\npanting hard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the \\nsilent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. \\nAs Buck grew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering \\nfor footing. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs \\nstarted up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle \\nsank down again and waited.  \\nBut Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness—imagination. \\nHe fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as \\nthough attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept low \\nto the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz’s left fore leg. There was a \\ncrunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs. \\nThrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and broke the \\nright fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz struggled madly \\nto keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming eyes, lolling tongues, \\nand silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in upon him as he had seen THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 36 \\nsimilar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past. Only this \\ntime he was the one who was beaten.  \\nThere was no hope for him. Buck was inexorable. Mercy was a thing \\nreserved for gentler climes. He manœuvred for the final rush. The circle \\nhad tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks. \\nHe could see them, beyond Spitz and to either side, half crouching for \\nthe spring, their eyes fixed upon h im. A pause seemed to fall. Every \\nanimal was motionless as though turned to stone. Only Spitz quivered \\nand bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with horrible \\nmenace, as though to frighten off impending death. Then Buck sprang in \\nand out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder. \\nThe dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as Spitz \\ndisappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on, the successful \\nchampion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and \\nfound it good.  \\n 37  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIV \\n \\nWHO HAS WON TO MASTERSHIP \\n \\n \\n  \\nH? Wot I say? I spik true w’en I say dat Buck two devils.”  \\n   This was François’s speech next morning when he  \\n   discovered Spitz missing and Buck covered with wounds. He \\ndrew him to the fire and by its light pointed them out.  \\n“Dat Spitz fight lak hell,” said Perrault, as he surveyed the gaping \\nrips and cuts.  \\n“An’ dat Buck fight lak two hells,” was François’s answer. “An’ \\nnow we make good time. No more Spitz, no more trouble, sure.”  \\nWhile Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the dog-\\ndriver proceeded to harness the dogs. Buck trotted up to the place Spitz \\nwould have occupied as leader; but François, not noticing him, brought \\nSol-leks to the coveted position. In his judgment, Sol-leks was the best \\nlead-dog left. Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury, driving him back and \\nstanding in his place.  \\n“Eh? eh?” François cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. “Look at dat \\nBuck. Heem keel dat Spitz, heem t’ink to take de job.”  \\n“Go ’way, Chook!” he cried, but Buck refused to budge.  \\nHe took Buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled \\nthreateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks. The old \\ndog did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck. \\nFrançois was obdurate, but when he turned his back Buck again \\ndisplaced Sol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.  \\nFrançois was angry. “Now, by Gar, I feex you!” he cried, coming \\nback with a heavy club in his hand.  “ E THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 38 \\nBuck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; \\nnor did he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought \\nforward. But he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with \\nbitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so as to \\ndodge it if thrown by François, for he was become wise in the way of \\nclubs.  \\nThe driver went about his work, and he called to Buck when he was \\nready to put him in his old place in front of Dave. Buck retreated two or \\nthree steps. François followed him up, whereupon he again retreated. \\nAfter some time of this, François threw down the club, thinking that \\nBuck feared a thrashing. But Buck was in open revolt. He wanted, not to \\nescape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. It was his by right. He had \\nearned it, and he would not be content with less.  \\nPerrault took a hand. Between them they ran him about for the better \\npart of an hour. They threw clubs at him. He dodged. They cursed him, \\nand his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after \\nhim down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and \\ndrop of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept out \\nof their reach. He did not try to run away, but retreated around and \\naround the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met, he \\nwould come in and be good.  \\nFrançois sat down and scratched his head. Perrault looked at his \\nwatch and swore. Time was flying, and they should have been on the \\ntrail an hour gone. François scratched his head again. He shook it and \\ngrinned sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign \\nthat they were beaten. Then François went up to where Sol-leks stood \\nand called to Buck. Buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. \\nFrançois unfastened Sol-leks’s traces and put him back in his old place. \\nThe team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the \\ntrail. There was no place for Buck save at the front. Once more François \\ncalled, and once more Buck laughed and kept away.  \\n“T’row down de club,” Perrault commanded.  \\nFrançois complied, whereupon Buck trotted in, laughing \\ntriumphantly, and swung around into position at the head of the team. WHO  HAS  WON  TO  MASTERSHIP 39 \\nHis traces were fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running \\nthey dashed out on to the river trail.  \\nHighly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck, with his two devils, \\nhe found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. At a \\nbound Buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was \\nrequired, and quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the \\nsuperior even of Spitz, of whom François had never seen an equal.  \\nBut it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that \\nBuck excelled. Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership. \\nIt was none of their business. Their business was to toil, and toil \\nmightily, in the traces. So long as that were not interfered with, they did \\nnot care what happened. Billee, the good-natured, could lead for all they \\ncared, so long as he kept order. The rest of the team, however, had \\ngrown unruly during the last days of Spitz, and their surprise was great \\nnow that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape.  \\nPike, who pulled at Buck’s heels, and who never put an ounce more \\nof his weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was \\nswiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was done \\nhe was pulling more than ever before in his life. The first night in camp, \\nJoe, the sour one, was punished roundly—a thing that Spitz had never \\nsucceeded in doing. Buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior \\nweight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for \\nmercy.  \\nThe general tone of the team picked up immediately. It recovered its \\nold-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the \\ntraces. At the Rink Rapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona, were \\nadded; and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away \\nFrançois’s breath.  \\n“Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!” he cried. “No, nevaire! Heem \\nworth one t’ousan’ dollair, by Gar! Eh? Wot you say, Perrault?”  \\nAnd Perrault nodded. He was ahead of the record then, and gaining \\nday by day. The trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, \\nand there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. It was not too \\ncold. The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 40 \\nthe whole trip. The men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on \\nthe jump, with but infrequent stoppages.  \\nThe Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice, and they \\ncovered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in. \\nIn one run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge \\nto the White Horse Rapids. Across Marsh, Tagish, and Bennett (seventy \\nmiles of lakes), they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run \\ntowed behind the sled at the end of a rope. And on the last night of the \\nsecond week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea slope \\nwith the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.  \\nIt was a record run. Each day for fourteen days they had averaged \\nforty miles. For three days Perrault and François threw chests up and \\ndown the main street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to \\ndrink, while the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of \\ndog-busters and mushers. Then three or four western bad men aspired to \\nclean out the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and \\npublic interest turned to other idols. Next came official orders. François \\ncalled Buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him. And that \\nwas the last of François and Perrault. Like other men, they passed out of \\nBuck’s life for good.  \\nA Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in \\ncompany with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary \\ntrail to Dawson. It was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy \\ntoil each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train, \\ncarrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the \\nshadow of the Pole.  \\nBuck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in \\nit after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks, and seeing that his mates, \\nwhether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. It was a monotonous \\nlife, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was very like \\nanother. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out, fires were \\nbuilt, and breakfast was eaten. Then, while some broke camp, others \\nharnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before the \\ndarkness fell which gave warning of dawn. At night, camp was made. \\nSome pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the beds, WHO  HAS  WON  TO  MASTERSHIP 41 \\nand still others carried water or ice for the cooks. Also, the dogs were \\nfed. To them, this was the one feature of the day, though it was good to \\nloaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so with the other \\ndogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. There were fierce fighters \\namong them, but three battles with the fiercest brought Buck to mastery, \\nso that when he bristled and showed his teeth, they got out of his way.  \\nBest of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched \\nunder him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes blinking \\ndreamily at the flames. Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller’s big \\nhouse in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley, and of the cement \\nswimming-tank, and Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, and Toots, the \\nJapanese pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the \\ndeath of Curly, the great fight with Spitz, and the good things he had \\neaten or would like to eat. He was not homesick. The Sunland was very \\ndim and distant, and such memories had no power over him. Far more \\npotent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never \\nseen before a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the \\nmemories of his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later \\ndays, and still later, in him, quickened and became alive again.  \\nSometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it \\nseemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched by \\nthis other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed cook \\nbefore him. This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm, with \\nmuscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and swelling. \\nThe hair of this man was long and matted, and his head slanted back \\nunder it from the eyes. He uttered strange sounds, and seemed very \\nmuch afraid of the darkness, into which he peered continually, clutching \\nin his hand, which hung midway between knee and foot, a stick with a \\nheavy stone made fast to the end. He was all but naked, a ragged and \\nfire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back, but on his body \\nthere was much hair. In some places, across the chest and shoulders and \\ndown the outside of the arms and thighs, it was matted into almost a \\nthick fur. He did not stand erect, but with trunk inclined forward from \\nthe hips, on legs that bent at the knees. About his body there was a THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 42 \\npeculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost catlike, and a quick alertness \\nas of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and unseen.  \\nAt other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between \\nhis legs and slept. On such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his \\nhands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms. \\nAnd beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, Buck could see many \\ngleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he knew to be \\nthe eyes of great beasts of prey. And he could hear the crashing of their \\nbodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night. \\nAnd dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the \\nfire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to \\nrise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his \\nneck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and the \\nhalf-breed cook shouted at him, “Hey, you Buck, wake up!” Whereupon \\nthe other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and \\nhe would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.  \\nIt was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work \\nwore them down. They were short of weight and in poor condition when \\nthey made Dawson, and should have had a ten days’ or a week’s rest at \\nleast. But in two days’ time they dropped down the Yukon bank from \\nthe Barracks, loaded with letters for the outside. The dogs were tired, the \\ndrivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. This \\nmeant a soft trail, greater friction on the runners, and heavier pulling for \\nthe dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all, and did their best for the \\nanimals.  \\nEach night the dogs were attended to first. They ate before the \\ndrivers ate, and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the \\nfeet of the dogs he drove. Still, their strength went down. Since the \\nbeginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles, \\ndragging sleds the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles \\nwill tell upon life of the toughest. Buck stood it, keeping his mates up to \\ntheir work and maintaining discipline, though he too was very tired. \\nBillee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night. Joe was \\nsourer than ever, and Sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side or other \\nside.  WHO  HAS  WON  TO  MASTERSHIP 43 \\nBut it was Dave who suffered most of all. Something had gone \\nwrong with him. He became more morose and irritable, and when camp \\nwas pitched at once made his nest, where his driver fed him. Once out of \\nthe harness and down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up \\ntime in the morning. Sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden \\nstoppage of the sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with \\npain. The driver examined him, but could find nothing. All the drivers \\nbecame interested in his case. They talked it over at meal-time, and over \\ntheir last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a \\nconsultation. He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed \\nand prodded till he cried out many times. Something was wrong inside, \\nbut they could locate no broken bones, could not make it out.  \\nBy the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he was so weak that he was \\nfalling repeatedly in the traces. The Scotch half-breed called a halt and \\ntook him out of the team, making the next dog, Sol-leks, fast to the sled. \\nHis intention was to rest Dave, letting him run free behind the sled. Sick \\nas he was, Dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling while \\nthe traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when he \\nsaw Sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. For the \\npride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not bear \\nthat another dog should do his work.  \\nWhen the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the \\nbeaten trail, attacking Sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him and \\ntrying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side, striving to \\nleap inside his traces and get between him and the sled, and all the while \\nwhining and yelping and crying with grief and pain. The half-breed tried \\nto drive him away with the whip; but he paid no heed to the stinging \\nlash, and the man had not the heart to strike harder. Dave refused to run \\nquietly on the trail behind the sled, where the going was easy, but \\ncontinued to flounder alongside in the soft snow, where the going was \\nmost difficult, till exhausted. Then he fell, and lay where he fell, \\nhowling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by.  \\nWith the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along \\nbehind till the train made another stop, when he floundered past the sleds \\nto his own, where he stood alongside Sol-leks. His driver lingered a THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 44 \\nmoment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind. Then he \\nreturned and started his dogs. They swung out on the trail with \\nremarkable lack of exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped in \\nsurprise. The driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. He \\ncalled his comrades to witness the sight. Dave had bitten through both of \\nSol-leks’s traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in his \\nproper place.  \\nHe pleaded with his eyes to remain there. The driver was perplexed. \\nHis comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being \\ndenied the work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, \\nwhere dogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were \\ncut out of the traces. Also, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die \\nanyway, that he should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. So he \\nwas harnessed in again, and proudly he pulled as of old, though more \\nthan once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt. \\nSeveral times he fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the \\nsled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs.  \\nBut he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place \\nfor him by the fire. Morning found him too weak to travel. At harness-up \\ntime he tried to crawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on his \\nfeet, staggered, and fell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly \\ntoward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. He would \\nadvance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching \\nmovement, when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again \\nfor a few more inches. His strength left him, and the last his mates saw \\nof him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they \\ncould hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a \\nbelt of river timber.  \\nHere the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his \\nsteps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A revolver-shot \\nrang out. The man came back hurriedly. The whips snapped, the bells \\ntinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but Buck knew, and \\nevery dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river trees.  \\n 45  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nV \\n \\nTHE TOIL OF TRACE AND TRAIL \\n \\n \\n  \\nHIRTY days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, \\n   with Buck and his mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. They \\n   were in a wretched state, worn out and worn down. Buck’s one \\nhundred and forty pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. The \\nrest of his mates, though lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight \\nthan he. Pike, the malingerer, who, in his lifetime of deceit, had often \\nsuccessfully feigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. Sol-leks was \\nlimping, and Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.  \\nThey were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in \\nthem. Their feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and \\ndoubling the fatigue of a day’s travel. There was nothing the matter with \\nthem except that they were dead tired. It was not the dead tiredness that \\ncomes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a \\nmatter of hours; but it was the dead tiredness that comes through the \\nslow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no \\npower of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had been \\nall used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre, every cell, was \\ntired, dead tired. And there was reason for it. In less than five months \\nthey had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during the last eighteen \\nhundred of which they had had but five days’ rest. When they arrived at \\nSkaguay, they were apparently on their last legs. They could barely keep \\nthe traces taut, and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the \\nway of the sled.  T THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 46 \\n“Mush on, poor sore feets,” the driver encouraged them as they \\ntottered down the main street of Skaguay. “Dis is de las’. Den we get \\none long res’. Eh? For sure. One bully long res’.”  \\nThe drivers confidently expected a long stopover. Themselves, they \\nhad covered twelve hundred miles with two days’ rest, and in the nature \\nof reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing. But \\nso many were the men who had rushed into the Klondike, and so many \\nwere the sweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the \\ncongested mail was taking on Alpine proportions; also, there were \\nofficial orders. Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the \\nplaces of those worthless for the trail. The worthless ones were to be got \\nrid of, and, since dogs count for little against dollars, they were to be \\nsold.  \\nThree days passed, by which time Buck and his mates found how \\nreally tired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, \\ntwo men from the States came along and bought them, harness and all, \\nfor a song. The men addressed each other as “Hal” and “Charles.” \\nCharles was a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery \\neyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the \\nlie to the limply drooping lip it concealed. Hal was a youngster of \\nnineteen or twenty, with a big Colt’s revolver and a hunting-knife \\nstrapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. This belt \\nwas the most salient thing about him. It advertised his callowness—a \\ncallowness sheer and unutterable. Both men were manifestly out of \\nplace, and why such as they should adventure the North is part of the \\nmystery of things that passes understanding.  \\nBuck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and \\nthe Government agent, and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the \\nmail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and \\nFrançois and the others who had gone before. When driven with his \\nmates to the new owners’ camp, Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly \\naffair, tent half stretched, dishes unwashed, every thing in disorder; also, \\nhe saw a woman. “Mercedes” the men called her. She was Charles’s \\nwife and Hal’s sister—a nice family party.  THE  TOIL  OF  TRACE  AND  TRAIL 47 \\nBuck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down \\nthe tent and load the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their \\nmanner, but no businesslike method. The tent was rolled into an \\nawkward bundle three times as large as it should have been. The tin \\ndishes were packed away unwashed. Mercedes continually fluttered in \\nthe way of her men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance \\nand advice. When they put a clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she \\nsuggested it should go on the back; and when they had put it on the \\nback, and covered it over with a couple of other bundles, she discovered \\noverlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very \\nsack, and they unloaded again.  \\nThree men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning \\nand winking at one another.  \\n“You’ve got a right smart load as it is,” said one of them; “and it’s \\nnot me should tell you your business, but I wouldn’t tote that tent along \\nif I was you.”  \\n“Undreamed of!” cried Mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty \\ndismay. “However in the world could I manage without a tent?”  \\n“It’s springtime, and you won’t get any more cold weather,” the man \\nreplied.  \\nShe shook her head decidedly, and Charles and Hal put the last odds \\nand ends on top the mountainous load.  \\n“Think it’ll ride?” one of the men asked.  \\n“Why shouldn’t it?” Charles demanded rather shortly.  \\n“Oh, that’s all right, that’s all right,” the man hastened meekly to \\nsay. “I was just a-wonderin’, that is all. It seemed a mite top-heavy.”  \\nCharles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he \\ncould, which was not in the least well.  \\n“An’ of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption \\nbehind them,” affirmed a second of the men.  \\n“Certainly,” said Hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the \\ngee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. “Mush!” \\nhe shouted. “Mush on there!”  \\nThe dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few \\nmoments, then relaxed. They were unable to move the sled.  THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 48 \\n“The lazy brutes, I’ll show them,” he cried, preparing to lash out at \\nthem with the whip.  \\nBut Mercedes interfered, crying, “Oh, Hal, you mustn’t,” as she \\ncaught hold of the whip and wrenched it from him. “The poor dears! \\nNow you must promise you won’t be harsh with them for the rest of the \\ntrip, or I won’t go a step.”  \\n“Precious lot you know about dogs,” her brother sneered; “and I \\nwish you’d leave me alone. They’re lazy, I tell you, and you’ve got to \\nwhip them to get anything out of them. That’s their way. You ask any \\none. Ask one of those men.”  \\nMercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of \\npain written in her pretty face.  \\n“They’re weak as water, if you want to know,” came the reply from \\none of the men. “Plum tuckered out, that’s what’s the matter. They need \\na rest.”  \\n“Rest be blanked,” said Hal, with his beardless lips; and Mercedes \\nsaid, “Oh!” in pain and sorrow at the oath.  \\nBut she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of \\nher brother. “Never mind that man,” she said pointedly. “You’re driving \\nour dogs, and you do what you think best with them.”  \\nAgain Hal’s whip fell upon the dogs. They threw themselves against \\nthe breast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it, \\nand put forth all their strength. The sled held as though it were an \\nanchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was \\nwhistling savagely, when once more Mercedes interfered. She dropped \\non her knees before Buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms \\naround his neck.  \\n“You poor, poor dears,” she cried sympathetically, “why don’t you \\npull hard?—then you wouldn’t be whipped.” Buck did not like her, but \\nhe was feeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day’s \\nmiserable work.  \\nOne of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress \\nhot speech, now spoke up:—  \\n“It’s not that I care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs’ \\nsakes I just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by breaking THE  TOIL  OF  TRACE  AND  TRAIL 49 \\nout that sled. The runners are froze fast. Throw your weight against the \\ngee-pole, right and left, and break it out.”  \\nA third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the \\nadvice, Hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. \\nThe overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, Buck and his mates \\nstruggling frantically under the rain of blows. A hundred yards ahead the \\npath turned and sloped steeply into the main street. It would have \\nrequired an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and Hal \\nwas not such a man. As they swung on the turn the sled went over, \\nspilling half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never stopped. \\nThe lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were angry \\nbecause of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load. Buck \\nwas raging. He broke into a run, the team following his lead. Hal cried \\n“Whoa! whoa!” but they gave no heed. He tripped and was pulled off his \\nfeet. The capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs dashed on up the \\nstreet, adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they scattered the remainder \\nof the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.  \\nKind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered \\nbelongings. Also, they gave advice. Half the load and twice the dogs, if \\nthey ever expected to reach Dawson, was what was said. Hal and his \\nsister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and \\noverhauled the outfit. Canned goods were turned out that made men \\nlaugh, for canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about. \\n“Blankets for a hotel” quoth one of the men who laughed and helped. \\n“Half as many is too much; get rid of them. Throw away that tent, and \\nall those dishes,—who’s going to wash them, anyway? Good Lord, do \\nyou think you’re travelling on a Pullman?”  \\nAnd so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. \\nMercedes cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and \\narticle after article was thrown out. She cried in general, and she cried in \\nparticular over each discarded thing. She clasped hands about knees, \\nrocking back and forth broken-heartedly. She averred she would not go \\nan inch, not for a dozen Charleses. She appealed to everybody and to \\neverything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even \\narticles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. And in her zeal, THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 50 \\nwhen she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her \\nmen and went through them like a tornado.  \\nThis accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a \\nformidable bulk. Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six \\nOutside dogs. These, added to the six of the original team, and Teek and \\nKoona, the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record trip, \\nbrought the team up to fourteen. But the Outside dogs, though \\npractically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much. Three \\nwere short-haired pointers, one was a Newfoundland, and the other two \\nwere mongrels of indeterminate breed. They did not seem to know \\nanything, these newcomers. Buck and his comrades looked upon them \\nwith disgust, and though he speedily taught them their places and what \\nnot to do, he could not teach them what to do. They did not take kindly \\nto trace and trail. With the exception of the two mongrels, they were \\nbewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in \\nwhich they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. \\nThe two mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things \\nbreakable about them.  \\nWith the newcomers hopeless and forlorn, and the old team worn out \\nby twenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail, the outlook was \\nanything but bright. The two men, however, were quite cheerful. And \\nthey were proud, too. They were doing the thing in style, with fourteen \\ndogs. They had seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson, or \\ncome in from Dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as \\nfourteen dogs. In the nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why \\nfourteen dogs should not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could \\nnot carry the food for fourteen dogs. But Charles and Hal did not know \\nthis. They had worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so \\nmany dogs, so many days, Q. E. D. Mercedes looked over their \\nshoulders and nodded comprehensively, it was all so very simple.  \\nLate next morning Buck led the long team up the street. There was \\nnothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. They were \\nstarting dead weary. Four times he had covered the distance between \\nSalt Water and Dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he was \\nfacing the same trail once more, made him bitter. His heart was not in THE  TOIL  OF  TRACE  AND  TRAIL 51 \\nthe work, nor was the heart of any dog. The Outsides were timid and \\nfrightened, the Insides without confidence in their masters.  \\nBuck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men \\nand the woman. They did not know how to do anything, and as the days \\nwent by it became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in \\nall things, without order or discipline. It took them half the night to pitch \\na slovenly camp, and half the morning to break that camp and get the \\nsled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they were \\noccupied in stopping and rearranging the load. Some days they did not \\nmake ten miles. On other days they were unable to get started at all. And \\non no day did they succeed in making more than half the distance used \\nby the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.  \\nIt was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. But they \\nhastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding \\nwould commence. The Outside dogs, whose digestions had not been \\ntrained by chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious \\nappetites. And when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled \\nweakly, Hal decided that the orthodox ration was too small. He doubled \\nit. And to cap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a \\nquaver in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more, \\nshe stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. But it was not food that \\nBuck and the huskies needed, but rest. And though they were making \\npoor time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.  \\nThen came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that his \\ndog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further, \\nthat for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So he \\ncut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day’s travel. \\nHis sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were frustrated by \\ntheir heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a simple matter to \\ngive the dogs less food; but it was impossible to make the dogs travel \\nfaster, while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning \\nprevented them from travelling longer hours. Not only did they not \\nknow how to work dogs, but they did not know how to work themselves.  \\nThe first to go was Dub. Poor blundering thief that he was, always \\ngetting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful worker. THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 52 \\nHis wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from bad to \\nworse, till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt’s revolver. It is a saying \\nof the country that an Outside dog starves to death on the ration of the \\nhusky, so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no less than die on \\nhalf the ration of the husky. The Newfoundland went first, followed by \\nthe three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels hanging more grittily \\non to life, but going in the end.  \\nBy this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had \\nfallen away from the three people. Shorn of its glamour and romance, \\nArctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and \\nwomanhood. Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too \\noccupied with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her \\nhusband and brother. To quarrel was the one thing they were never too \\nweary to do. Their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it, \\ndoubled upon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of the trail \\nwhich comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of \\nspeech and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. They \\nhad no inkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their \\nmuscles ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because \\nof this they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their \\nlips in the morning and last at night.  \\nCharles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. \\nIt was the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the \\nwork, and neither forbore to speak his belief at every opportunity. \\nSometimes Mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her \\nbrother. The result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. Starting \\nfrom a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a \\ndispute which concerned only Charles and Hal), presently would be \\nlugged in the rest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people \\nthousands of miles away, and some of them dead. That Hal’s views on \\nart, or the sort of society plays his mother’s brother wrote, should have \\nanything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes \\ncomprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that \\ndirection as in the direction of Charles’s political prejudices. And that \\nCharles’s sister’s tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the building THE  TOIL  OF  TRACE  AND  TRAIL 53 \\nof a Yukon fire, was apparent only to Mercedes, who disburdened \\nherself of copious opinions upon that topic, and incidentally upon a few \\nother traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband’s family. In the \\nmeantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp half pitched, and the dogs \\nunfed.  \\nMercedes nursed a special grievance—the grievance of sex. She was \\npretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. But the \\npresent treatment by her husband and brother was everything save \\nchivalrous. It was her custom to be helpless. They complained. Upon \\nwhich impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex-\\nprerogative, she made their lives unendurable. She no longer considered \\nthe dogs, and because she was sore and tired, she persisted in riding on \\nthe sled. She was pretty and soft, but she weighed one hundred and \\ntwenty pounds—a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and \\nstarving animals. She rode for days, till they fell in the traces and the \\nsled stood still. Charles and Hal begged her to get off and walk, pleaded \\nwith her, entreated, the while she wept and importuned Heaven with a \\nrecital of their brutality.  \\nOn one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. They \\nnever did it again. She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat \\ndown on the trail. They went on their way, but she did not move. After \\nthey had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for her, \\nand by main strength put her on the sled again.  \\nIn the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering \\nof their animals. Hal’s theory, which he practised on others, was that one \\nmust get hardened. He had started out preaching it to his sister and \\nbrother-in-law. Failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a club. \\nAt the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old squaw \\noffered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the Colt’s \\nrevolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal’s hip. A poor \\nsubstitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped from the \\nstarved horses of the cattlemen six months back. In its frozen state it was \\nmore like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog wrestled it into his \\nstomach, it thawed into thin and innutritious leathery strings and into a \\nmass of short hair, irritating and indigestible.  THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 54 \\nAnd through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in \\na nightmare. He pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he \\nfell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to \\nhis feet again. All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his beautiful \\nfurry coat. The hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted with dried \\nblood where Hal’s club had bruised him. His muscles had wasted away \\nto knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so that each rib and \\nevery bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that \\nwas wrinkled in folds of emptiness. It was heartbreaking, only Buck’s \\nheart was unbreakable. The man in the red sweater had proved that.  \\nAs it was with Buck, so was it with his mates. They were \\nperambulating skeletons. There were seven all together, including him. \\nIn their very great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the \\nlash or the bruise of the club. The pain of the beating was dull and \\ndistant, just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull \\nand distant. They were not half living, or quarter living. They were \\nsimply so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. \\nWhen a halt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, \\nand the spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. And when the \\nclub or whip fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they \\ntottered to their feet and staggered on.  \\nThere came a day when Billee, the good-natured, fell and could not \\nrise. Hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked \\nBillee on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of the \\nharness and dragged it to one side. Buck saw, and his mates saw, and \\nthey knew that this thing was very close to them. On the next day Koona \\nwent, and but five of them remained: Joe, too far gone to be malignant; \\nPike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not conscious \\nenough longer to malinger; Sol-leks, the one-eyed, still faithful to the \\ntoil of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so little strength with \\nwhich to pull; Teek, who had not travelled so far that winter and who \\nwas now beaten more than the others because he was fresher; and Buck, \\nstill at the head of the team, but no longer enforcing discipline or \\nstriving to enforce it, blind with weakness half the time and keeping the \\ntrail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet.  THE  TOIL  OF  TRACE  AND  TRAIL 55 \\nIt was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were \\naware of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by \\nthree in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole \\nlong day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had given \\nway to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur arose \\nfrom all the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from the things \\nthat lived and moved again, things which had been as dead and which \\nhad not moved during the long months of frost. The sap was rising in the \\npines. The willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds. Shrubs \\nand vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets sang in the \\nnights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling things rustled \\nforth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and \\nknocking in the forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds singing, and \\noverhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in cunning \\nwedges that split the air.  \\nFrom every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of \\nunseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The \\nYukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate \\naway from beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, fissures \\nsprang and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bod ily \\ninto the river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of \\nawakening life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing \\nbreezes, like wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and \\nthe huskies.  \\nWith the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing \\ninnocuously, and Charles’s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into \\nJohn Thornton’s camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted, \\nthe dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. \\nMercedes dried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down \\non a log to rest. He sat down very slowly and painstakingly, what of his \\ngreat stiffness. Hal did the talking. John Thornton was whittling the last \\ntouches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled \\nand listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse \\nadvice. He knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that it \\nwould not be followed.  THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 56 \\n“They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail \\nand that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,” Hal said in response \\nto Thornton’s warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice. “They \\ntold us we couldn’t make White River, and here we are.” This last with a \\nsneering ring of triumph in it.  \\n“And they told you true,” John Thornton answered. “The bottom’s \\nlikely to drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of \\nfools, could have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn’t risk my carcass \\non that ice for all the gold in Alaska.”  \\n“That’s because you’re not a fool, I suppose,” said Hal. “All the \\nsame, we’ll go on to Dawson.” He uncoiled his whip. “Get up there, \\nBuck! Hi! Get up there! Mush on!”  \\nThornton went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a \\nfool and his folly, while two or three fools more or less would not alter \\nthe scheme of things.  \\nBut the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed \\ninto the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed \\nout, here and there, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed \\nhis lips. Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed. Joe \\ncame next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he fell \\nover, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck made \\nno effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The lash bit into him again \\nand again, but he neither whined nor struggled. Several times Thornton \\nstarted, as though to speak, but changed his mind. A moisture came into \\nhis eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked \\nirresolutely up and down.  \\nThis was the first time Buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason to \\ndrive Hal into a rage. He exchanged the whip for the customary club. \\nBuck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell \\nupon him. Like his mates, he was barely able to get up, but, unlike them, \\nhe had made up his mind not to get up. He had a vague feeling of \\nimpending doom. This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to \\nthe bank, and it had not departed from him. What of the thin and rotten \\nice he had felt under his feet all day, it seemed that he sensed disaster \\nclose at hand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to THE  TOIL  OF  TRACE  AND  TRAIL 57 \\ndrive him. He refused to stir. So greatly had he suffered, and so far gone \\nwas he, that the blows did not hurt much. And as they continued to fall \\nupon him, the spark of life within flickered and went down. It was nearly \\nout. He felt strangely numb. As though from a great distance, he was \\naware that he was being beaten. The last sensations of pain left him. He \\nno longer felt anything, though very faintly he could hear the impact of \\nthe club upon his body. But it was no longer his body, it seemed so far \\naway.  \\nAnd then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was \\ninarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang \\nupon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as \\nthough struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on \\nwistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his \\nstiffness.  \\nJohn Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, too \\nconvulsed with rage to speak.  \\n“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say \\nin a choking voice.  \\n“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he \\ncame back. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m going to Dawson.”  \\nThornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of \\ngetting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes \\nscreamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of \\nhysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking \\nthe knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick \\nit up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut \\nBuck’s traces.  \\nHal had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with his \\nsister, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further \\nuse in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the \\nbank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see. \\nPike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were Joe and \\nTeek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the \\nloaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in \\nthe rear.  THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 58 \\nAs Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, \\nkindly hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had \\ndisclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible \\nstarvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched \\nit crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop \\ndown, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the \\nair. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and \\nmake one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and \\ndogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. \\nThe bottom had dropped out of the trail.  \\nJohn Thornton and Buck looked at each other.  \\n“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.  \\n 59  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nVI \\n \\nFOR THE LOVE OF A MAN \\n \\n \\n  \\nHEN John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December, \\n   his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get \\n   well, going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-\\nlogs for Dawson. He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued \\nBuck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left \\nhim. And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days, \\nwatching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the \\nhum of nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.  \\nA rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, \\nand it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his \\nmuscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For \\nthat matter, they were all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and \\nNig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to \\nDawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with \\nBuck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first advances. \\nShe had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a mother cat \\nwashes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck’s wounds. \\nRegularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast, she \\nperformed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her \\nministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly, \\nthough less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and \\nhalf deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature. To \\nBuck’s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. They \\nseemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton. As Buck W THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 60 \\ngrew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in \\nwhich Thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion \\nBuck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. Love, \\ngenuine passionate love, was his for the first time. This he had never \\nexperienced at Judge Miller’s down in the sun-kissed Santa Clara \\nValley. With the Judge’s sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a \\nworking partnership; with the Judge’s grandsons, a sort of pompous \\nguardianship; and with the Judge himself, a stately and dignified \\nfriendship. But love that was feverish and burning, that was adoration, \\nthat was madness, it had taken John Thornton to arouse.  \\nThis man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he \\nwas the ideal master. Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a \\nsense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as if \\nthey were his own children, because he could not help it. And he saw \\nfurther. He never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to sit \\ndown for a long talk with them (“gas” he called it) was as much his \\ndelight as theirs. He had a way of taking Buck’s head roughly between \\nhis hands, and resting his own head upon Buck’s, of shaking him back \\nand forth, the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love names. \\nBuck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of \\nmurmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart \\nwould be shaken out of his body, so great was its ecstasy. And when, \\nreleased, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his eyes eloquent, his \\nthroat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion remained \\nwithout movement, John Thornton would reverently exclaim, “God! you \\ncan all but speak!”  \\nBuck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. He would \\noften seize Thornton’s hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the \\nflesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward. And as Buck \\nunderstood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this \\nfeigned bite for a caress.  \\nFor the most part, however, Buck’s love was expressed in adoration. \\nWhile he went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or \\nspoke to him, he did not seek these tokens. Unlike Skeet, who was wont \\nto shove her nose under Thornton’s hand and nudge and nudge till FOR  THE  LOVE  OF  A  MAN 61 \\npetted, or Nig, who would stalk up and rest his great head on Thornton’s \\nknee, Buck was content to adore at a distance. He would lie by the hour, \\neager, alert, at Thornton’s feet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon \\nit, studying it, following with keenest interest each fleeting expression, \\nevery movement or change of feature. Or, as chance might have it, he \\nwould lie farther away, to the side or rear, watching the outlines of the \\nman and the occasional movements of his body. And often, such was the \\ncommunion in which they lived, the strength of Buck’s gaze would draw \\nJohn Thornton’s head around, and he would return the gaze, without \\nspeech, his heart shining out of his eyes as Buck’s heart shone out.  \\nFor a long time after his rescue, Buck did not like Thornton to get \\nout of his sight. From the moment he left the tent to when he entered it \\nagain, Buck would follow at his heels. His transient masters since he had \\ncome into the Northland had bred in him a fear that no master could be \\npermanent. He was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his life as \\nPerrault and François and the Scotch half-breed had passed out. Even in \\nthe night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. At such times he \\nwould shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the tent, \\nwhere he would stand and listen to the sound of his master’s breathing.  \\nBut in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton, which seemed \\nto bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive, which \\nthe Northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active. \\nFaithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet he \\nretained his wildness and wiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come in \\nfrom the wild to sit by John Thornton’s fire, rather than a dog of the soft \\nSouthland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization. \\nBecause of his very great love, he could not steal from this man, but \\nfrom any other man, in any other camp, he did not hesitate an instant; \\nwhile the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection.  \\nHis face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he \\nfought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. Skeet and Nig were too \\ngood-natured for quarrelling,—besides, they belonged to John Thornton; \\nbut the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly \\nacknowledged Buck’s supremacy or found himself struggling for life \\nwith a terrible antagonist. And Buck was merciless. He had learned well THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 62 \\nthe law of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew \\nback from a foe he had started on the way to Death. He had lessoned \\nfrom Spitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and \\nknew there was no middle course. He must master or be mastered; while \\nto show mercy was a weakness. Mercy did not exist in the primordial \\nlife. It was misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made for \\ndeath. Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this mandate, \\ndown out of the depths of Time, he obeyed.  \\nHe was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had \\ndrawn. He linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him \\nthrobbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the \\ntides and seasons swayed. He sat by John Thornton’s fire, a broad-\\nbreasted dog, white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the \\nshades of all manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and \\nprompting, tasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he \\ndrank, scenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the \\nsounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods, directing \\nhis actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down, and \\ndreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff \\nof his dreams.  \\nSo peremptorily did these shades beckon him, that each day mankind \\nand the claims of mankind slipped farther from him. Deep in the forest a \\ncall was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously \\nthrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and \\nthe beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on and on, \\nhe knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the call \\nsounding imperiously, deep in the forest. But as often as he gained the \\nsoft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for John Thornton \\ndrew him back to the fire again.  \\nThornton alone held him. The rest of mankind was as nothing. \\nChance travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, \\nand from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. \\nWhen Thornton’s partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected \\nraft, Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to \\nThornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting FOR  THE  LOVE  OF  A  MAN 63 \\nfavors from them as though he favored them by accepting. They were of \\nthe same large type as Thornton, living close to the earth, thinking \\nsimply and seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy \\nby the saw-mill at Dawson, they understood Buck and his ways, and did \\nnot insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet and Nig.  \\nFor Thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. He, \\nalone among men, could put a pack upon Buck’s back in the summer \\ntravelling. Nothing was too great for Buck to do, when Thornton \\ncommanded. One day (they had grub-staked themselves from the \\nproceeds of the raft and left Dawson for the head-waters of the Tanana) \\nthe men and dogs were sitting on the crest of a cliff which fell away, \\nstraight down, to naked bed-rock three hundred feet below. John \\nThornton was sitting near the edge, Buck at his shoulder. A thoughtless \\nwhim seized Thornton, and he drew the attention of Hans and Pete to the \\nexperiment he had in mind. “Jump, Buck!” he commanded, sweeping his \\narm out and over the chasm. The next instant he was grappling with \\nBuck on the extreme edge, while Hans and Pete were dragging them \\nback into safety.  \\n“It’s uncanny,” Pete said, after it was over and they had caught their \\nspeech.  \\nThornton shook his head. “No, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too. \\nDo you know, it sometimes makes me afraid.”  \\n“I’m not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he’s \\naround,” Pete announced conclusively, nodding his head toward Buck.  \\n“Py Jingo!” was Hans’s contribution, “not mineself either.”  \\nIt was at Circle City, ere the year was out, that Pete’s apprehensions \\nwere realized. “Black” Burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had \\nbeen picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when Thornton \\nstepped good-naturedly between. Buck, as was his custom, was lying in \\na corner, head on paws, watching his master’s every action. Burton \\nstruck out, without warning, straight from the shoulder. Thornton was \\nsent spinning, and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail \\nof the bar.  \\nThose who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, \\nbut a something which is best described as a roar, and they saw Buck’s THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 64 \\nbody rise up in the air as he left the floor for Burton’s throat. The man \\nsaved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm, but was hurled \\nbackward to the floor with Buck on top of him. Buck loosed his teeth \\nfrom the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. This time the \\nman succeeded only in partly blocking, and his throat was torn open. \\nThen the crowd was upon Buck, and he was driven off; but while a \\nsurgeon checked the bleeding, he prowled up and down, growling \\nfuriously, attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of \\nhostile clubs. A “miners’ meeting,” called on the spot, decided that the \\ndog had sufficient provocation, and Buck was discharged. But his \\nreputation was made, and from that day his name spread through every \\ncamp in Alaska.  \\nLater on, in the fall of the year, he saved John Thornton’s life in \\nquite another fashion. The three partners were lining a long and narrow \\npoling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans \\nand Pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin Manila rope from \\ntree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent by \\nmeans of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. Buck, on the bank, \\nworried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off his \\nmaster.  \\nAt a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks \\njutted out into the river, Hans cast off the rope, and, while Thornton \\npoled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in his \\nhand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. This it did, and was \\nflying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race, when Hans \\nchecked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. The boat flirted over \\nand snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while Thornton, flung sheer out \\nof it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of the rapids, a \\nstretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.  \\nBuck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred \\nyards, amid a mad swirl of water, he overhauled Thornton. When he felt \\nhim grasp his tail, Buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his \\nsplendid strength. But the progress shoreward was slow; the progress \\ndown-stream amazingly rapid. From below came the fatal roaring where \\nthe wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the FOR  THE  LOVE  OF  A  MAN 65 \\nrocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. The suck \\nof the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful, \\nand Thornton knew that the shore was impossible. He scraped furiously \\nover a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with crushing \\nforce. He clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing Buck, and \\nabove the roar of the churning water shouted: “Go, Buck! Go!”  \\nBuck could not hold his own, and swept on down-stream, struggling \\ndesperately, but unable to win back. When he heard Thornton’s \\ncommand repeated, he partly reared out of the water, throwing his head \\nhigh, as though for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. \\nHe swam powerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the \\nvery point where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.  \\nThey knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the \\nface of that driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as fast \\nas they could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was \\nhanging on. They attached the line with which they had been snubbing \\nthe boat to Buck’s neck and shoulders, being careful that it should \\nneither strangle him nor impede his swimming, and launched him into \\nthe stream. He struck out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream. \\nHe discovered the mistake too late, when Thornton was abreast of him \\nand a bare half-dozen strokes away while he was being carried \\nhelplessly past.  \\nHans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though Buck were a boat. \\nThe rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current, he was \\njerked under the surface, and under the surface he remained till his body \\nstruck against the bank and he was hauled out. He was half drowned, \\nand Hans and Pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into \\nhim and the water out of him. He staggered to his feet and fell down. \\nThe faint sound of Thornton’s voice came to them, and though they \\ncould not make out the words of it, they knew that he was in his \\nextremity. His master’s voice acted on Buck like an electric shock, He \\nsprang to his feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of \\nhis previous departure.  \\nAgain the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he \\nstruck out, but this time straight into the stream. He had miscalculated THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 66 \\nonce, but he would not be guilty of it a second time. Hans paid out the \\nrope, permitting no slack, while Pete kept it clear of coils. Buck held on \\ntill he was on a line straight above Thornton; then he turned, and with \\nthe speed of an express train headed down upon him. Thornton saw him \\ncoming, and, as Buck struck him like a battering ram, with the whole \\nforce of the current behind him, he reached up and closed with both \\narms around the shaggy neck. Hans snubbed the rope around the tree, \\nand Buck and Thornton were jerked under the water. Strangling, \\nsuffocating, sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, \\ndragging over the jagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they \\nveered in to the bank.  \\nThornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled \\nback and forth across a drift log by Hans and Pete. His first glance was \\nfor Buck, over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting \\nup a howl, while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes. \\nThornton was himself bruised and battered, and he went carefully over \\nBuck’s body, when he had been brought around, finding three broken \\nribs.  \\n“That settles it,” he announced. “We camp right here.” And camp \\nthey did, till Buck’s ribs knitted and he was able to travel.  \\nThat winter, at Dawson, Buck performed another exploit, not so \\nheroic, perhaps, but one that put his name many notches higher on the \\ntotem-pole of Alaskan fame. This exploit was particularly gratifying to \\nthe three men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished, and \\nwere enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin East, where \\nminers had not yet appeared. It was brought about by a conversation in \\nthe Eldorado Saloon, in which men waxed boastful of their favorite \\ndogs. Buck, because of his record, was the target for these men, and \\nThornton was driven stoutly to defend him. At the end of half an hour \\none man stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds \\nand walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for his dog; and a \\nthird, seven hundred.  \\n“Pooh! pooh!” said John Thornton; “Buck can start a thousand \\npounds.”  FOR  THE  LOVE  OF  A  MAN 67 \\n“And break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?” \\ndemanded Matthewson, a Bonanza King, he of the seven hundred vaunt.  \\n“And break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,” John \\nThornton said coolly.  \\n“Well,” Matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could \\nhear, “I’ve got a thousand dollars that says he can’t. And there it is.” So \\nsaying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna sausage \\ndown upon the bar.  \\nNobody spoke. Thornton’s bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. He \\ncould feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. His tongue had \\ntricked him. He did not know whether Buck could start a thousand \\npounds. Half a ton! The enormousness of it appalled him. He had great \\nfaith in Buck’s strength and had often thought him capable of starting \\nsuch a load; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the eyes \\nof a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. Further, he had no \\nthousand dollars; nor had Hans or Pete.  \\n“I’ve got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fifty-pound sacks \\nof flour on it,” Matthewson went on with brutal directness; “so don’t let \\nthat hinder you.”  \\nThornton did not reply. He did not know what to say. He glanced \\nfrom face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of \\nthought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it \\ngoing again. The face of Jim O’Brien, a Mastodon King and old-time \\ncomrade, caught his eyes. It was as a cue to him, seeming to rouse him \\nto do what he would never have dreamed of doing.  \\n“Can you lend me a thousand?” he asked, almost in a whisper.  \\n“Sure,” answered O’Brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by the \\nside of Matthewson’s. “Though it’s little faith I’m having, John, that the \\nbeast can do the trick.”  \\nThe Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. \\nThe tables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to \\nsee the outcome of the wager and to lay odds. Several hundred men, \\nfurred and mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. \\nMatthewson’s sled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been \\nstanding for a couple of hours, and in the intense cold (it was sixty THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 68 \\nbelow zero) the runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. Men \\noffered odds of two to one that Buck could not budge the sled. A quibble \\narose concerning the phrase “break out.” O’Brien contended it was \\nThornton’s privilege to knock the runners loose, leaving Buck to “break \\nit out” from a dead standstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase \\nincluded breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A \\nmajority of the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in \\nhis favor, whereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck.  \\nThere were no takers. Not a man believed him capable of the feat. \\nThornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now \\nthat he looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular team \\nof ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible the task \\nappeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.  \\n“Three to one!” he proclaimed. “I’ll lay you another thousand at that \\nfigure, Thornton. What d’ye say?”  \\nThornton’s doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was \\naroused—the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize the \\nimpossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He called Hans \\nand Pete to him. Their sacks were slim, and with his own the three \\npartners could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the ebb of their \\nfortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid it unhesitatingly \\nagainst Matthewson’s six hundred.  \\nThe team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his own \\nharness, was put into the sled. He had caught the contagion of the \\nexcitement, and he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for \\nJohn Thornton. Murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went \\nup. He was in perfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, \\nand the one hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many \\npounds of grit and virility. His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. \\nDown the neck and across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, \\nhalf bristled and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess \\nof vigor made each particular hair alive and active. The great breast and \\nheavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the \\nbody, where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men FOR  THE  LOVE  OF  A  MAN 69 \\nfelt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went \\ndown to two to one.  \\n“Gad, sir! Gad, sir!” stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king \\nof the Skookum Benches. “I offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before \\nthe test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.”  \\nThornton shook his head and stepped to Buck’s side.  \\n“You must stand off from him,” Matthewson protested. “Free play \\nand plenty of room.”  \\nThe crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers \\nvainly offering two to one. Everybody acknowledged Buck a \\nmagnificent animal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too \\nlarge in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.  \\nThornton knelt down by Buck’s side. He took his head in his two \\nhands and rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was \\nhis wont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. “As \\nyou love me, Buck. As you love me,” was what he whispered. Buck \\nwhined with suppressed eagerness.  \\nThe crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing \\nmysterious. It seemed like a conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, \\nBuck seized his mittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his \\nteeth and releasing slowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, \\nnot of speech, but of love. Thornton stepped well back.  \\n“Now, Buck,” he said.  \\nBuck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several \\ninches. It was the way he had learned.  \\n“Gee!” Thornton’s voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.  \\nBuck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took \\nup the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty \\npounds. The load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp \\ncrackling.  \\n“Haw!” Thornton commanded.  \\nBuck duplicated the manœuvre, this time to the left. The crackling \\nturned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and \\ngrating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were \\nholding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.  THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 70 \\n“Now, MUSH!”  \\nThornton’s command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw \\nhimself forward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole \\nbody was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the \\nmuscles writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His \\ngreat chest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his \\nfeet were flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in \\nparallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward. \\nOne of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled \\nlurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it \\nnever really came to a dead stop again . . . half an inch . . . an inch . . . \\ntwo inches. . . . The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained \\nmomentum, he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.  \\nMen gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment \\nthey had ceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging \\nBuck with short, cheery words. The distance had been measured off, and \\nas he neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred \\nyards, a cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he \\npassed the firewood and halted at command. Every man was tearing \\nhimself loose, even Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air. \\nMen were shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling \\nover in a general incoherent babel.  \\nBut Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was against head, \\nand he was shaking him back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him \\ncursing Buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and \\nlovingly.  \\n“Gad, sir! Gad, sir!” spluttered the Skookum Bench king. “I’ll give \\nyou a thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir—twelve hundred, sir.”  \\nThornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were \\nstreaming frankly down his cheeks. “Sir,” he said to the Skookum Bench \\nking, “no, sir. You can go to hell, sir. It’s the best I can do for you, sir.”  \\nBuck seized Thornton’s hand in his teeth. Thornton shook him back \\nand forth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers \\ndrew back to a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet \\nenough to interrupt.  71  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nVII \\n \\nTHE SOUNDING OF THE CALL \\n \\n \\n  \\nHEN Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for \\n   John Thornton, he made it possible for his master to pay off \\n   certain debts and to journey with his partners into the East \\nafter a fabled lost mine, the history of which was as old as the history of \\nthe country. Many men had sought it; few had found it; and more than a \\nfew there were who had never returned from the quest. This lost mine \\nwas steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the \\nfirst man. The oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. From \\nthe beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying \\nmen had sworn to it, and to the mine the site of which it marked, \\nclinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade \\nof gold in the Northland.  \\nBut no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were \\ndead; wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck and half a \\ndozen other dogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve \\nwhere men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. They sledded \\nseventy miles up the Yukon, swung to the left into the Stewart River, \\npassed the Mayo and the McQuestion, and held on until the Stewart \\nitself became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked \\nthe backbone of the continent.  \\nJohn Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the \\nwild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the \\nwilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased. \\nBeing in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course of W THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 72 \\nthe day’s travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he kept on \\ntravelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to \\nit. So, on this great journey into the East, straight meat was the bill of \\nfare, ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled, and \\nthe time-card was drawn upon the limitless future.  \\nTo Buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and \\nindefinite wandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they \\nwould hold on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they \\nwould camp, here and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes \\nthrough frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by \\nthe heat of the fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they \\nfeasted riotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune \\nof hunting. Summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, \\nrafted across blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown \\nrivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.  \\nThe months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through \\nthe uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been \\nif the Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer \\nblizzards, shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between \\nthe timber line and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid \\nswarming gnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked \\nstrawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could \\nboast. In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad \\nand silent, where wild-fowl had been, but where then there was no life \\nnor sign of life—only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in \\nsheltered places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely \\nbeaches.  \\nAnd through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails \\nof men who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed \\nthrough the forest, an ancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. \\nBut the path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained \\nmystery, as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained \\nmystery. Another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a \\nhunting lodge, and amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton \\nfound a long-barrelled flint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay THE  SOUNDING  OF  THE  CALL 73 \\nCompany gun of the young days in the Northwest, when such a gun was \\nworth its height in beaver skins packed flat, And that was all—no hint as \\nto the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun \\namong the blankets.  \\nSpring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they \\nfound, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where \\nthe gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-\\npan. They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them \\nthousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every \\nday. The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, \\nand piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like \\ngiants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they \\nheaped the treasure up.  \\nThere was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat \\nnow and again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing \\nby the fire. The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more \\nfrequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often, blinking \\nby the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which he \\nremembered.  \\nThe salient thing of this other world seemed fear. When he watched \\nthe hairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands \\nclasped above, Buck saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and \\nawakenings, at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness \\nand fling more wood upon the fire. Did they walk by the beach of a sea, \\nwhere the hairy man gathered shell-fish and ate them as he gathered, it \\nwas with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs \\nprepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. Through the forest \\nthey crept noiselessly, Buck at the hairy man’s heels; and they were alert \\nand vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving and nostrils \\nquivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as Buck. The hairy \\nman could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the \\nground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb, sometimes a dozen feet \\napart, letting go and catching, never falling, never missing his grip. In \\nfact, he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground; and THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 74 \\nBuck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath trees wherein the \\nhairy man roosted, holding on tightly as he slept.  \\nAnd closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still \\nsounding in the depths of the forest. It filled him with a great unrest and \\nstrange desires. It caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness, and he \\nwas aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what. \\nSometimes he pursued the call into the forest, looking for it as though it \\nwere a tangible thing, barking softly or defiantly, as the mood might \\ndictate. He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss, or into the \\nblack soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the fat earth \\nsmells; or he would crouch for hours, as if in concealment, behind \\nfungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared to all \\nthat moved and sounded about him. It might be, lying thus, that he \\nhoped to surprise this call he could not understand. But he did not know \\nwhy he did these various things. He was impelled to do them, and did \\nnot reason about them at all.  \\nIrresistible impulses seized him. He would be lying in camp, dozing \\nlazily in the heat of the day, when suddenly his head would lift and his \\nears cock up, intent and listening, and he would spring to his feet and \\ndash away, and on and on, for hours, through the forest aisles and across \\nthe open spaces where the niggerheads bunched. He loved to run down \\ndry watercourses, and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods. \\nFor a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch \\nthe partridges drumming and strutting up and down. But especially he \\nloved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights, listening to the \\nsubdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading signs and sounds as \\nman may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious something, that \\ncalled—called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him to come.  \\nOne night he sprang from sleep with a start, eager-eyed, nostrils \\nquivering and scenting, his mane bristling in recurrent waves. From the \\nforest came the call (or one note of it, for the call was many noted), \\ndistinct and definite as never before,—a long-drawn howl, like, yet \\nunlike, any noise made by husky dog. And he knew it, in the old familiar \\nway, as a sound heard before. He sprang through the sleeping camp and \\nin swift silence dashed through the woods. As he drew closer to the cry THE  SOUNDING  OF  THE  CALL 75 \\nhe went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he came to an \\nopen place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on haunches, \\nwith nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.  \\nHe had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to \\nsense his presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body \\ngathered compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with \\nunwonted care. Every movement advertised commingled threatening \\nand overture of friendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the \\nmeeting of wild beasts that prey. But the wolf fled at sight of him. He \\nfollowed, with wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He ran him into a \\nblind channel, in the bed of the creek, where a timber jam barred the \\nway. The wolf whirled about, pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion \\nof Joe and of all cornered husky dogs, snarling and bristling, clipping his \\nteeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.  \\nBuck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with \\nfriendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made \\nthree of him in weight, while his head barely reached Buck’s shoulder. \\nWatching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time \\nand again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in \\npoor condition or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him. He \\nwould run till Buck’s head was even with his flank, when he would \\nwhirl around at bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.  \\nBut in the end Buck’s pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding \\nthat no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they \\nbecame friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with \\nwhich fierce beasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the \\nwolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was \\ngoing somewhere. He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, and \\nthey ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek \\nbed, into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide \\nwhere it took its rise.  \\nOn the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level \\ncountry where were great stretches of forest and many streams, and \\nthrough these great stretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the sun \\nrising higher and the day growing warmer. Buck was wildly glad. He THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 76 \\nknew he was at last answering the call, running by the side of his wood \\nbrother toward the place from where the call surely came. Old memories \\nwere coming upon him fast, and he was stirring to them as of old he \\nstirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. He had done this \\nthing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world, and \\nhe was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked earth \\nunderfoot, the wide sky overhead.  \\nThey stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, Buck \\nremembered John Thornton. He sat down. The wolf started on toward \\nthe place from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing \\nnoses and making actions as though to encourage him. But Buck turned \\nabout and started slowly on the back track. For the better part of an hour \\nthe wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. Then he sat down, \\npointed his nose upward, and howled. It was a mournful howl, and as \\nBuck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it \\nwas lost in the distance.  \\nJohn Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and \\nsprang upon h im in a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling \\nupon him, licking his face, biting his hand—“playing the general tom-\\nfool,” as John Thornton characterized it, the while he shook Buck back \\nand forth and cursed him lovingly.  \\nFor two days and nights Buck never left camp, never let Thornton \\nout of his sight. He followed him about at his work, watched him while \\nhe ate, saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. \\nBut after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously \\nthan ever. Buck’s restlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by \\nrecollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land beyond the \\ndivide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches. Once \\nagain he took to wandering in the woods, but the wild brother came no \\nmore; and though he listened through long vigils, the mournful howl was \\nnever raised.  \\nHe began to sleep out at night, staying away from camp for days at a \\ntime; and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went \\ndown into the land of timber and streams. There he wandered for a \\nweek, seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother, killing his meat THE  SOUNDING  OF  THE  CALL 77 \\nas he travelled and travelling with the long, easy lope that seems never \\nto tire. He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere \\ninto the sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded by \\nthe mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest \\nhelpless and terrible. Even so, it was a hard fight, and it aroused the last \\nlatent remnants of Buck’s ferocity. And two days later, when he returned \\nto his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the spoil, he \\nscattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two behind who would \\nquarrel no more.  \\nThe blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He was a \\nkiller, a thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, \\nby virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a \\nhostile environment where only the strong survived. Because of all this \\nhe became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated \\nitself like a contagion to his physical being. It advertised itself in all his \\nmovements, was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke plainly as \\nspeech in the way he carried himself, and made his glorious furry coat if \\nanything more glorious. But for the stray brown on his muzzle and \\nabove his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down \\nhis chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf, larger \\nthan the largest of the breed. From his St. Bernard father he had \\ninherited size and weight, but it was his shepherd mother who had given \\nshape to that size and weight. His muzzle was the long wolf muzzle, \\nsave that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his head, \\nsomewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale.  \\nHis cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence, \\nshepherd intelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this, plus an \\nexperience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable a \\ncreature as any that roamed the wild. A carnivorous animal, living on a \\nstraight meat diet, he was in full flower, at the high tide of his life, \\noverspilling with vigor and virility. When Thornton passed a caressing \\nhand along his back, a snapping and crackling followed the hand, each \\nhair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact. Every part, brain and \\nbody, nerve tissue and fibre, was keyed to the most exquisite pitch; and \\nbetween all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment. To THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 78 \\nsights and sounds and events which required action, he responded with \\nlightning-like rapidity. Quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend \\nfrom attack or to attack, he could leap twice as quickly. He saw the \\nmovement, or heard sound, and responded in less time than another dog \\nrequired to compass the mere seeing or hearing. He perceived and \\ndetermined and responded in the same instant. In point of fact the three \\nactions of perceiving, determining, and responding were sequential; but \\nso infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they \\nappeared simultaneous. His muscles were surcharged with vitality, and \\nsnapped into play sharply, like steel springs. Life streamed through him \\nin splendid flood, glad and rampant, until it seemed that it would burst \\nhim asunder in sheer ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world.  \\n“Never was there such a dog,” said John Thornton one day, as the \\npartners watched Buck marching out of camp.  \\n“When he was made, the mould was broke,” said Pete.  \\n“Py jingo! I t’ink so mineself,” Hans affirmed.  \\nThey saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant \\nand terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within \\nthe secrecy of the forest. He no longer marched. At once he became a \\nthing of the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow that \\nappeared and disappeared among the shadows. He knew how to take \\nadvantage of every cover, to crawl on his belly like a snake, and like a \\nsnake to leap and strike. He could take a ptarmigan from its nest, kill a \\nrabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air the little chipmunks fleeing a \\nsecond too late for the trees. Fish, in open pools, were not too quick for \\nhim; nor were the beaver, mending their dams, too wary. He killed to \\neat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he killed himself. \\nSo a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was his delight to steal \\nupon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them, to let them go, \\nchattering in mortal fear to the tree-tops.  \\nAs the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater \\nabundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less \\nrigorous valleys. Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown \\ncalf; but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and \\nhe came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. A band THE  SOUNDING  OF  THE  CALL 79 \\nof twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber, \\nand chief among them was a great bull. He was in a savage temper, and, \\nstanding over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist \\nas even Buck could desire. Back and forth the bull tossed his great \\npalmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet \\nwithin the tips. His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light, \\nwhile he roared with fury at sight of Buck.  \\nFrom the bull’s side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered \\narrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct \\nwhich came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck \\nproceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He \\nwould bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach of the \\ngreat antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped \\nhis life out with a single blow. Unable to turn his back on the fanged \\ndanger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage. At \\nsuch moments he charged Buck, who retreated craftily, luring him on by \\na simulated inability to escape. But when he was thus separated from his \\nfellows, two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon Buck \\nand enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.  \\nThere is a patience of the wild—dogged, tireless, persistent as life \\nitself—that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web, the \\nsnake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience belongs \\npeculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it belonged to Buck \\nas he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding its march, irritating the \\nyoung bulls, worrying the cows with their half-grown calves, and \\ndriving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage. For half a day this \\ncontinued. Buck multiplied himself, attacking from all sides, enveloping \\nthe herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out his victim as fast as it \\ncould rejoin its mates, wearing out the patience of creatures preyed \\nupon, which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying.  \\nAs the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the \\nnorthwest (the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six \\nhours long), the young bulls retraced their steps more and more \\nreluctantly to the aid of their beset leader. The down-coming winter was \\nharrying them on to the lower levels, and it seemed they could never THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 80 \\nshake off this tireless creature that held them back. Besides, it was not \\nthe life of the herd, or of the young bulls, that was threatened. The life of \\nonly one member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than their \\nlives, and in the end they were content to pay the toll.  \\nAs twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his \\nmates—the cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he \\nhad mastered—as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading \\nlight. He could not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless \\nfanged terror that would not let him go. Three hundredweight more than \\nhalf a ton he weighed; he had lived a long, strong life, full of fight and \\nstruggle, and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature whose \\nhead did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.  \\nFrom then on, night and day, Buck never left his prey, never gave it \\na moment’s rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the \\nshoots of young birch and willow. Nor did he give the wounded bull \\nopportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams \\nthey crossed. Often, in desperation, he burst into long stretches of flight. \\nAt such times Buck did not attempt to stay him, but loped easily at his \\nheels, satisfied with the way the game was played, lying down when the \\nmoose stood still, attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink.  \\nThe great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and \\nthe shambling trot grew weak and weaker. He took to standing for long \\nperiods, with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and \\nBuck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to \\nrest. At such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes \\nfixed upon the big bull, it appeared to Buck that a change was coming \\nover the face of things. He could feel a new stir in the land. As the \\nmoose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were coming in. \\nForest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. The \\nnews of it was borne in upon him, not by sight, or sound, or smell, but \\nby some other and subtler sense. He heard nothing, saw nothing, yet \\nknew that the land was somehow different; that through it strange things \\nwere afoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate after he had \\nfinished the business in hand.  THE  SOUNDING  OF  THE  CALL 81 \\nAt last, at the end of the fourth day, he pulled the great moose down. \\nFor a day and a night he remained by the kill, eating and sleeping, turn \\nand turn about. Then, rested, refreshed and strong, he turned his face \\ntoward camp and John Thornton. He broke into the long easy lope, and \\nwent on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way, heading \\nstraight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that \\nput man and his magnetic needle to shame.  \\nAs he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in \\nthe land. There was life abroad in it different from the life which had \\nbeen there throughout the summer. No longer was this fact borne in \\nupon him in some subtle, mysterious way. The birds talked of it, the \\nsquirrels chattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it. Several \\ntimes he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs, \\nreading a message which made him leap on with greater speed. He was \\noppressed with a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity \\nalready happened; and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped \\ndown into the valley toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.  \\nThree miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair \\nrippling and bristling, It led straight toward camp and John Thornton. \\nBuck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and tense, \\nalert to the multitudinous details which told a story—all but the end. His \\nnose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the \\nheels of which he was travelling. He remarked the pregnant silence of \\nthe forest. The bird life had flitted. The squirrels were in hiding. One \\nonly he saw,—a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray dead limb so \\nthat he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the wood itself.  \\nAs Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his \\nnose was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had \\ngripped and pulled it. He followed the new scent into a thicket and found \\nNig. He was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an \\narrow protruding, head and feathers, from either side of his body.  \\nA hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs \\nThornton had bought in Dawson. This dog was thrashing about in a \\ndeath-struggle, directly on the trail, and Buck passed around him without \\nstopping. From the camp came the faint sound of many voices, rising THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 82 \\nand falling in a sing-song chant. Bellying forward to the edge of the \\nclearing, he found Hans, lying on his face, feathered with arrows like a \\nporcupine. At the same instant Buck peered out where the spruce-bough \\nlodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck \\nand shoulders. A gust of overpowering rage swept over him. He did not \\nknow that he growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity. For \\nthe last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason, \\nand it was because of his great love for John Thornton that he lost his \\nhead.  \\nThe Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough \\nlodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an \\nanimal the like of which they had never seen before. It was Buck, a live \\nhurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. He \\nsprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the Yeehats), ripping the \\nthroat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood. He did \\nnot pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with the next bound \\ntearing wide the throat of a second man. There was no withstanding him. \\nHe plunged about in their very midst, tearing, rending, destroying, in \\nconstant and terrific motion which defied the arrows they discharged at \\nhim. In fact, so inconceivably rapid were his movements, and so closely \\nwere the Indians tangled together, that they shot one another with the \\narrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear at Buck in mid air, drove \\nit through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point \\nbroke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond. Then a panic \\nseized the Yeehats, and they fled in terror to the woods, proclaiming as \\nthey fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.  \\nAnd truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and \\ndragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. It was a \\nfateful day for the Yeehats. They scattered far and wide over the \\ncountry, and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors \\ngathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses. As for \\nBuck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated camp. He \\nfound Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment \\nof surprise. Thornton’s desperate struggle was fresh-written on the earth, \\nand Buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep pool. By THE  SOUNDING  OF  THE  CALL 83 \\nthe edge, head and fore feet in the water, lay Skeet, faithful to the last. \\nThe pool itself, muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes, effectually \\nhid what it contained, and it contained John Thornton; for Buck \\nfollowed his trace into the water, from which no trace led away.  \\nAll day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the \\ncamp. Death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away \\nfrom the lives of the living, he knew, and he knew John Thornton was \\ndead. It left a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void \\nwhich ached and ached, and which food could not fill, At times, when he \\npaused to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats, he forgot the pain of \\nit; and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself,—a pride \\ngreater than any he had yet experienced. He had killed man, the noblest \\ngame of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang. He \\nsniffed the bodies curiously. They had died so easily. It was harder to \\nkill a husky dog than them. They were no match at all, were it not for \\ntheir arrows and spears and clubs. Thenceforward he would be unafraid \\nof them except when they bore in their hands their arrows, spears, and \\nclubs.  \\nNight came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky, \\nlighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the coming of \\nthe night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became alive to a \\nstirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats \\nhad made, He stood up, listening and scenting. From far away drifted a \\nfaint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps. As the \\nmoments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. Again Buck knew \\nthem as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory. \\nHe walked to the centre of the open space and listened. It was the call, \\nthe many-noted call, sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever \\nbefore. And as never before, he was ready to obey. John Thornton was \\ndead. The last tie was broken. Man and the claims of man no longer \\nbound him.  \\nHunting their living meat, as the Yeehats were hunting it, on the \\nflanks of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over \\nfrom the land of streams and timber and invaded Buck’s valley. Into the \\nclearing where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood; THE  CALL  OF  THE  WILD 84 \\nand in the centre of the clearing stood Buck, motionless as a statue, \\nwaiting their coming. They were awed, so still and large he stood, and a \\nmoment’s pause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him. Like a \\nflash Buck struck, breaking the neck. Then he stood, without movement, \\nas before, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him. Three others \\ntried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they drew back, \\nstreaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.  \\nThis was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, \\ncrowded together, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down \\nthe prey. Buck’s marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good \\nstead. Pivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was \\neverywhere at once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken \\nso swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side. But to prevent them \\nfrom getting behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and \\ninto the creek bed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank. He \\nworked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the \\ncourse of mining, and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three \\nsides and with nothing to do but face the front.  \\nAnd so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves \\ndrew back discomfited. The tongues of all were out and lolling, the \\nwhite fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. Some were lying \\ndown with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their \\nfeet, watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool. \\nOne wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly \\nmanner, and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for \\na night and a day. He was whining softly, and, as Buck whined, they \\ntouched noses.  \\nThen an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. Buck \\nwrithed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with \\nhim, Whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and \\nbroke out the long wolf howl. The others sat down and howled. And \\nnow the call came to Buck in unmistakable accents. He, too, sat down \\nand howled. This over, he came out of his angle and the pack crowded \\naround him, sniffing in half-friendly, half-savage manner. The leaders \\nlifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods. The wolves THE  SOUNDING  OF  THE  CALL 85 \\nswung in behind, yelping in chorus. And Buck ran with them, side by \\nside with the wild brother, yelping as he ran.  \\nAnd here may well end the story of Buck. The years were not many \\nwhen the Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for \\nsome were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a \\nrift of white centring down the chest. But more remarkable than this, the \\nYeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack. They are \\nafraid of this Ghost Dog, for it has cunning greater than they, stealing \\nfrom their camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps, slaying their \\ndogs, and defying their bravest hunters.  \\nNay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to the \\ncamp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with \\nthroats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow \\ngreater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats follow \\nthe movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they never \\nenter. And women there are who become sad when the word goes over \\nthe fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an abiding-\\nplace.  \\nIn the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which \\nthe Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like, and \\nyet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling timber \\nland and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here a yellow \\nstream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground, \\nwith long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould overrunning it \\nand hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses for a time, \\nhowling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.  \\nBut he is not always alone. When the long winter nights come on \\nand the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be seen \\nrunning at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or \\nglimmering borealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat \\na-bellow as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of \\nthe pack.
